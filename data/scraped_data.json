She has graduated 25 PhD students, with most going to faculty positions (12) or research positions in government or industry (9), and has worked with 30+ master's students, 100+ undergraduate researchers, and 10+ high school students. A majority of her students are from groups underrepresented in computing. Her group has developed several groundbreaking approaches for biasing sampling that have enabled sampling-based motion planning, the dominant approach in use today in robotics, to be applied in areas where it was not feasible before. She and her students were the first to use these methods to study protein motion and folding. She is also known for her work in computational geometry, including the development of approximate convex decomposition (ACD) for partitioning polyhedra, and parallel algorithms, including novel approaches for parallel graph traversals.\nAmato's current research focus for robotics is exploring task planning and interaction in dynamic multi-robot systems, including collaboration with other robots and humans. In computational biology, she is interested studying protein-drug interaction and binding site accessibility. For all these, she is investigating methods that incorporate learning at various levels and leverage workspace topology. In parallel and distributed computing, she is continuing her longstanding collaboration with Lawrence Rauchwerger on the STAPL (Standard Templates Adaptive Parallel Library) project with a particular interest on approximate parallel algorithms for large and dynamic graphs.  She is also co-leading an exciting new multi-disciplinary and multi-university NSF Expeditions in Computing project \u2013 Mind in Vitro \u2013 that is seeking to build a computing system based on living biological neurons.\nLeadership roles and broadening participation in computing.

The department and university administration provide many committees and mechanisms to uphold this Code. There are, however, situations where these mechanisms may be unclear and/or engaging with such a committee may be too intimidating.\n \nThe role of CARES is to serve as a resource consisting of members of our community who are approachable and willing to listen to and help people who are concerned about or experience a potential violation of the Code. The committee members can be a sounding board for such concerns and can provide advice on next steps to address the concerns. Such steps may range from a conversation among all parties (possibly informally mediated by CARES members) to a report filed to the appropriate department or university committee seeking an official action or response. At the request of the complainant and if appropriate, a CARES committee member may serve as an advocate on behalf of the complainant, including filing necessary reports and attending hearings with the complainant or on their behalf. \n \nWe emphasize that the CARES committee cannot itself undertake any official investigations or enforce sanctions. CARES committee members are also not trained to provide mental health counseling. The committee must obey all the rules of the University of Illinois, Grainger College of Engineering, and the Department of Computer Science, including the stipulations of Title IX. All CS CARES committee members with the exception of undergraduate students are considered Title IX Responsible Employees. Click here for more information about Responsible Employees.\n \nThe motivation in providing a standing CARES committee is: (1) people are more likely to report violations of the Code if familiar and trusted members of the community are explicitly available for confidential consultation and support, (2) providing an explicit resource to discuss such matters may, in some cases, encourage earlier reporting, when it is easier to find mitigations, (3) an established committee with significant length membership terms enables building experience and a record that inspires more trust for those considering coming forward about violations, (4) committee members are expected to be visible and available to the community through various channels such as office hours and frequently monitored electronic media, and (5) the presence of such a committee assigned specifically to uphold the Code should serve as a deterrent for violations of the Code as well as encourage us all to be aware of it, uphold it, and speak up if we observe violations.\nAcknowledgements: The CARES committee idea and this text draw heavily from the SIGARCH/SIGMICRO CARES committee concept and its bylaws and the position of the faculty ombudsperson at the College of Engineering at the Texas A&M University.\n\nUpcoming Events\n  No events found\n  Go to Calendars"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/contact-us", "data": "HomeAboutContact Us & Office Locations\nContact Us & Office Locations\nAbout Overview\nRankings & Statistics\nContact Us & Office Locations\nHistory Timeline\nAccreditation\nValues & Code of Conduct\nCS CARES Committee\nPeople\nOpen Positions\nAwards\nCalendar\nDepartment of Computer Science\nVisit us on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus, or in downtown Chicago.\nThomas M.

CARES representatives announce their presence at these events.\nSupport: CARES supports community members in addressing concerns about violations of the Code in ways described in the \u201cPurpose\u201d section of this document, while respecting the ethics, confidentiality, and conflicts of interest rules described in the next section.\nOutreach: CARES conducts outreach to make the CS community aware of the Code and the role of CARES in enabling the community to uphold the Code.\nCARES committee members are expected to contribute equally to achieve the above goals for CARES. \nThe initial CARES committees will also be responsible for evolution of various aspects of CARES operations. For example, mechanisms to archive confidential CARES records (in collaboration with IT staff) need to be developed.\nIt is expected that the department, college, and/or university will make training materials available to CARES members in the future. CARES members are expected to complete all such training as these materials become available.\nCS CARES Committee: Ethics, Confidentiality, and Conflicts of Interest\nCommittee members are held to the highest standards of conduct and discretion. They must abide by all pertinent rules of the University of Illinois and of Title IX.  \nAll concerns brought to CARES members are treated with utmost confidentiality outside of CARES, unless permitted by the person raising the concern. By default, all concerns are conveyed to the CARES chair and the vice-chair, who use their discretion and determination of conflicts of interest (see below) to determine a subset of the committee with whom to share the concern. The community member raising the concern may explicitly request that it not be shared with certain members of the CARES committee.\nIf a violation of the Code is reported against a committee member, the member is recused from CARES activities until a decision on the credibility of the report can be made. An official investigation that finds such a report to be credible results in removal of the member from CARES. \nIf a CARES committee member has a conflict of interest with the person against whom a concern is reported to them (e.g., advisor/advisee, collaborator, close colleague, etc.), the committee member will immediately refer the reporter to another committee member. A committee member with a conflict of interest on a concern cannot participate in any discussion related to the concern."}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/cs-cares/governance", "data": "HomeAboutCS CARES CommitteeGovernance\nCS CARES Committee\n\nPurpose\n\nGovernance\n\nMembers &\nResponsibilities\n\nResources\n\nContact CS CARES\n\n\nNext\nAbout Overview\nRankings & Statistics\nContact Us & Office Locations\nHistory Timeline\nAccreditation\nValues & Code of Conduct\nCS CARES Committee\nContact CS CARES\nGovernance\nMembers\nResources\nPeople\nOpen Positions\nAwards\nCalendar\nCS CARES Committee: Governance\nAlthough CARES is a committee of the CS department, it operates independently of the department administration, similar to the current Advisory Committee. The autonomous operation is to increase the trust of all community members and affirm that CARES commits to offer support only in the best interests of the people who report concerns. CARES governance seeks to strike a balance in acknowledging the need for such autonomy, while also the need for support and stewardship by the department. \nCommittee Structure\nThe CARES committee will consist of a chair, a vice-chair, a past chair, and several committee members. There must be at least: two faculty members from each of the three tenure-track levels (assistant, associate, full); two members from the specialized  faculty; two staff members; one graduate student; and one undergraduate student. The committee, as a whole, must represent, to the extent possible, the diversity of the CS community, including, but not restricted to, gender, ethnicity, and race.\nTo provide a tighter connection with the department governance, one of the committee members (and preferably no more than one) is an elected member of the Advisory Committee (chosen by consensus of the chairs of the CARES and the Advisory Committees). \nIt is usually expected that at the end of their term, the vice-chair will be the new chair of the committee and the current chair will serve as past chair. The vice-chair is therefore expected to play an active role in the committee during their term and the past chair is expected to primarily play an advisory role.\nCommittee members normally are invited to serve for a 2 year term, with a maximum of 6 years served consecutively, and a minimum of 4 years away from the committee before serving again.  Committee members who serve as vice-chair, chair, or past chair may serve longer in these positions.\nCommittee Member Appointments\nThe members of the CARES committee are chosen largely for their commitment and record on the issues covered by the Code. Because of the gravity and personal nature of the issues that may appear before this committee, ensuring committee members are empathetic, trustworthy, and discreet is of the utmost importance. \nAt the end of each academic year, the department will solicit recommendations for new members of the CARES committee from different constituents (faculty, staff, and students) and convey them to the current CARES chair. The CARES committee will vet these recommendations (e.g., with the Advisory committee chair, student organization representatives, and collaborators of the nominee) and prepare a final candidate list by consensus. The CARES chair will convey this list to the head of the department. The Head will invite new members from this list, balancing other faculty load and CARES\u2019 diversity considerations. There is no maximum limit on the number of members in the committee.\nAt the end of each academic year, the CARES chair, vice-chair, and past chair will review the service of each committee member that has completed their two year term and if a renewal for another term is appropriate, add them to the list submitted to the department head above. It is intended that members will desire to renew their terms at least once, with the goal of rotating no more than a quarter of the committee each year (of course, this is unlikely for undergraduates).\nThe chair must be a full professor of the CS department. At the cadence of every two years, in the summer in which their terms expire, the chair and vice-chair nominate (one or two) candidates for the next vice-chair (from the committee membership for the subsequent year). The vice-chair and chair seek input on these nominations from the rest of the committee for the current year and from the chair of the Advisory committee to make the final decision on the new vice-chair.\nA committee member may be removed from the committee by consensus of the chair and vice-chair if any problems arise (e.g., breach of confidence). The head of the department is informed of the removal, but confidentiality reasons may not permit sharing the reasons for removal. Removal of the vice-chair must occur in consultation with and approval of the Advisory committee. If problems arise with the chair, then on the petition of more than half the members of the CARES committee, the advisory committee may consider removal and replacement of the chair.\nReporting and Oversight\nAlthough CARES will work autonomously, the final responsibility for its appropriate functioning rests with the department. The CARES chair will submit an annual report to the department's Advisory committee. Individual reports of concerns and conversations with committee members are unequivocally private.  The goal of the CARES report is to summarize the nature and scale of climate related concerns within the department, but without inappropriate or confidential details. The CARES and Advisory committee chairs will discuss this report with the Head, with the goal of further surveying the department climate, discussing mechanisms to improve the climate, and providing training materials to CARES and community members, as deemed necessary.\nSupporting Roles\nA representative from the department\u2019s human resources team will serve on the committee in an advisory role.\nThe BPC Coordinator serves as administrative support for the CS CARES committee. They adhere to the same high standards of conduct, discretion, and confidentiality as other committee members. They will attend CS CARES committee meetings in an administrative capacity to steward concerns submitted to the committee, help resolve conflicts of interest, and maintain accurate and confidential records of CS CARES activities using FERPA compliant tools. They will assist with meeting and office hours scheduling, coordinate CS CARES event representation, and facilitate committee communications as needed."}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/history-timeline", "data": "HomeAboutHistory Timeline\nHistory Timeline\nAbout Overview\nRankings & Statistics\nContact Us & Office Locations\nHistory Timeline\nAccreditation\nValues & Code of Conduct\nCS CARES Committee\nPeople\nOpen Positions\nAwards\nCalendar\nOur history and achievements form the basis for our strong tradition of excellence in education and research.\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AT ILLINOIS\n\n1946 UI faculty attempt to build a computer that can play checkers. ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator) is built at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n1948 John von Neumann, a pioneer in computer design at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, suggests that the Illinois research group build a computer. J. Robert Oppenheimer gives Illinois permission to build a copy of von Neumann's proposed machine.\nJohn Bardeen co-invents the transistor at Bell Telephone Laboratories, for which he wins the Nobel Prize in 1956. He would become professor of physics and electrical engineering at the University in 1951.\n1949 The U.S. Army and the University of Illinois jointly fund the construction of two computers, ORDVAC and ILLIAC (ILLInois Automated Computer). The Digital Computer Laboratory is organized. Ralph Meagher, a physicist and chief engineer for ORDVAC, is head.\n\n1951 ORDVAC (Ordnance Variable Automated Computer), one of the fastest computers in existence, is completed.\n\n1952 ORDVAC moves to the Army Ballistic Research Laboratory in Aberdeen, Maryland. It is used remotely from Illinois via a teletype circuit up to eight hours each night until the ILLIAC computer is completed.\n1952 ILLIAC, the first computer built and owned entirely by an educational institution, becomes operational. It was ten feet long, two feet wide, and eight and one-half feet high, contained 2,800 vacuum tubes, and weighed five tons.\n\n1955 A four-bit prototype transistorized computer is constructed.\n\n1957 UI faculty demonstrate a flip-flop 10 times faster than any other design in use.\n\n1958 Professor James E. Robertson, an electrical engineer and expert in error-checking systems, pioneers basic techniques of efficient binary division. The SRT division algorithm, now found both in hardware and software implementations of the divide instruction and widely used in the most powerful microprocessors, is named after D. Sweeney, Robertson, and T.D. Tocher, who independently invented the method at about the same time.\n1961 UI faculty demonstrate advanced \"virtual load\" circuits with one nanosecond rise and fall times.\nUsing the ILLIAC as a computational engine, UI faculty introduce PLATO, the nation's first computer-assisted program of instruction. PLATO, conceived by physics professor Chalmers Sherwin and developed under the direction of electrical engineering professor Don Bitzer, co-inventor of the plasma display panel, was the world's first time-shared computer-based education system as well as the home of the first on-line community.\nBy 1987, the PLATO network would offer more than 12,000 instructional hours in some 100 subjects to on-campus terminals and others scattered across the globe.\n1962 ILLIAC II, a transistorized computer 100 times faster than the original ILLIAC, becomes operational. ACM Computing Reviews says of the machine, \"ILLIAC II, at its conception in the mid-1950s, represents the spearhead and breakthrough into a new generation of machines.\"\n\n1963 A pattern recognition computer, being designed at Illinois since 1960, becomes the ILLIAC III project. The machine was to analyze bubble chamber photographs of high-energy particle events.\nProfessor Donald B. Gillies discovered three Mersenne prime numbers while testing ILLIAC II, including the largest then known prime number, 2**11213 -1, which is over 3,000 digits.\n1964 The Digital Computer Laboratory is reorganized as the Department of Computer Science, and John Pasta becomes its head. Pasta, a physicist, had previously worked at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (now Los Alamos National Laboratory) and the Atomic Energy Commission.\n\n1965 The University of Illinois, DARPA, and Burroughs collaborate on the development of the ILLIAC IV, the largest and fastest computer in the world. The ILLIAC IV project, headed by Professor Daniel Slotnick, pioneers the new concept of parallel computation. Slotnick had worked under John von Neumann at Princeton. ILLIAC IV was a SIMD computer (single instruction, multiple data) and it marked the first use of circuit card design automation outside IBM. It was also the first to employ ECL (Emitter-Coupled Logic) integrated circuits and multilayer (up to twelve layers) circuit boards on a large scale. Most notable was its use of semiconductor memory.\nThe department's undergraduate degree program in mathematics and computer science is established in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.\n1966 A graduate degree program in computer science is established in the Graduate College.\nGene Golub (BS Math '53, MA Stats '54, PhD Math '59), creator of the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm, helps found the Computer Science Department at Stanford University.\n1967 Our first PhD is awarded (to Thomas Slivinski), and our first MS is awarded (to Dugald Henderson).\n1969 Clarence Ellis becomes the first African-American to receive a PhD in computer science.\n1970 Professor C. W. Gear develops the first successful general program for solving stiff differential equations.\nProfessor James Snyder, a physicist and programmer for ILLIAC I, becomes head of the Department of Computer Science.\nDavid Kuck and his students pioneer techniques to translate conventional code into parallel code, starting with Analyzer around 1970. Other systems included Parafrase (ca. 1976), Parafrase2 (ca. 1988), and Polaris (ca. 1992)\n1971  The department's undergraduate degree program in the College of Engineering is approved by the Board of Trustees in September. At the same time, a bachelor's degree administered by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, \"Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\" is renamed to \"Computer Engineering.\" \n\n1972 UI Professor John Bardeen wins a second Nobel Prize in physics for developing the theory of superconductivity.\nThe department's undergraduate degree program in computer science is established in the College of Engineering.\n1973 C. L. Liu and J.W. Layland develop the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm, the theoretical basis of modern methods and tools for predicting the timing behavior of multiprogrammed real-time systems.\nPLATO's communications features bloom. Its system of personal notes and an early form of e-mail (written by student Kim Mast), and group notes, a form of groupware (written by student David Woolley) were precursors of today's electronic community. Later, alumni Steve Dorner (Eudora email program) and Ray Ozzie (Lotus Notes groupware) will commercialize and popularize features introduced with PLATO.\n\n1974 ILLIAC IV becomes operational at the Institute for Advanced Computation, Moffett Field, California.\n\n1975 Illinois is awarded UNIX license number one by Bell Laboratories. Graduate student Greg Chesson becomes the third person to contribute to the Bell Labs UNIX kernel.\n\n1976 Illinois researchers use computers to prove the four-color theorem, a long-standing conjecture in graph theory.\n\n1977 Professor Roy Campbell develops PATH Pascal, a language for expressing concurrency.\nProfessor David Kuck and his co-workers introduced dependence graphs and analysis and transformation techniques for the computation and manipulation of these graphs. This extraordinarily influential work enables many of today's program optimization algorithms, especially those for parallelism exploitation and locality enhancement.\n1978 University of Illinois Library, the largest public university library in the country, is among the first to provide public on-line access to a major collection.\n\n1981 The National Science Foundation grants the Department of Computer Science $4.2 million to develop a major new departmental research computing facility.\n\n1982 Department of Computer Science ranks first in the nation in influence of publications.\n\n1983 The Illinois Cache Coherence Protocol, developed by Janek Patel in 1983, became the standard IEEE MESI standard and is used today by virtually all cache coherent shared memory multi-processors.\n\n1985 NASA funds the establishment of the Illinois Center of Excellence in Aerospace Computing (ICLASS).\nProfessor C. William Gear becomes head of the computer science department. Gear was a pioneer in automatic numerical methods. In addition to writing the operating system for ILLIAC II, he created a groundbreaking method for solving stiff ordinary differential equations on digital computers and wrote a landmark computer program for the automatic integration of ordinary differential equations.\nConstruction of a hierarchical shared-memory supercomputer called Cedar begins, led by Professor David Kuck. This SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) system embodied advances in interconnection networks, control unit support of parallelism, optimizing compilers and parallel algorithms and applications.\nThe National Science Foundation establishes the Center for Supercomputing Research and Development (CSRD) and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), making the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign the nation's only university campus with two supercomputing centers.\n1986 NCSA Telnet software written by computer science students Gaige Paulsen, Tim Krauskopf, and Aaron Contorer, allows users to access remote hosts from their desktops.\n\n1988 National Science Foundation funds CISE Institutional Infrastructure grant for the Tapestry Project to build a heterogeneous parallel system.\nThe Supercomputing Research and Development complete construction of Cedar.\nThe department's undergraduate degree program in statistics and computer science is established in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.\n1989 Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology opens. This major multidisciplinary institute is devoted to basic research in physical sciences and engineering and in life and behavioral sciences.\n1990 Duncan Lawrie, who designed and implemented the first high-level language for ILLIAC IV and who was a principal architect of Cedar, becomes head of the Department of Computer Science.\nEudora, one of the world's most popular e-mail programs, is released by CCSO programmer and computer science alumnus Steve Dorner.\n1991 Professor Herbert Edelsbrunner becomes the first computer scientist to win the NSF Alan T. Waterman Award for his fundamental contributions to computational geometry.\n\n1992 The Whole Internet, the first user's guide to the Internet, is written by CCSO programmer and computer science alumnus Ed Krol.\n\n1993 NCSA develops Mosaic and sparks the World Wide Web revolution. Most of the development was done by computer science students and alumni, including Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina.\nPERTS (Prototyping Environment for Real-Time Systems), a system of analysis, validation, and simulation is developed under the direction of Professor Jane Liu.\n1995 NCSA aids the White House, the City of Chicago, and others in establishing their World Wide Web sites. UI is selected as one of six test sites for the National Science Foundation's Digital Library Project.

Note that passing the Exam does not guarantee admission, nor is it required for your application.\nThe Data Structures Proficiency Exam assumes prior knowledge of basic object-oriented programming, the ability to analyze asymptotic algorithmic run times, e.g. whether a program runs in O(n) or O(n log n) time, and to implement basic data structures including arrays, hash tables, linked lists, trees, heaps and graphs, as well as algorithms for traversals, rebalancing and shortest paths. For those needing a review, the Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization offered by Illinois on Coursera covers these topics.\nExam Details\nThe exam is hosted on PrairieLearn (a University of Illinois online assessment platform) and is proctored by ProctorU (an online third-party proctoring service).  \nProspective applicants must not access the exam on PrairieLean platform until instructed to do so by the proctor.  Accessing the exam before the proctor approves will result in the exam attempt being voided, and the department will decline to accept your application for admission.\nThe exam is 3 hours long.\nA grade of B+ on the exam (in addition to a minimum 3.2/4.0 GPA in the last two years of the undergraduate degree) is required for the application to be considered in the admission process.\nA maximum of three attempts within 12 consecutive months are allowed. A minimum of 30 calendar days' learning period is required between any two consecutive exam attempts.\nTimeline \nExam results are released within two weeks of the exam attempt.\nThe exam must be completed and grade report uploaded to your application for admission, which must be submitted by the application deadline. \nApplication deadlines for the Professional Online MCS are posted here.\nHow to Schedule and Take Your Exam\nDue to system maintenance, the Data Structures Proficiency Exam cannot be scheduled on Saturdays between the hours of 5 am and 1 pm central time.\nAn Illinois, Gmail, or Microsoft Exchange email account is required to access PrairieLearn. If you do not have an appropriate email address, please create a Gmail address for the purpose of the exam. Gmail users should use the \"Google\" login option on PrairieLearn.  The email address used for the exam must match the email address associated with your application for admission as well as the email address that you use for ProctorU. Please update the email associated with your application, if necessary, by logging back into your application to change the email address.  You must use the same email address each time that you take the exam.\nAccessing and completing the exam without a proctor and/or failing to observe the mandatory thirty-day long learning period between exam attempts will be considered academic integrity violations. The exam attempt will be voided, and the department will decline to accept your application for admission.\nPay the ProctorU fee of $30.25 for the 3-hour exam.\nSchedule your exam appointment at least 72 hours prior to your appointment time, or an additional late fee of $12 will be charged. If retaking the exam and you schedule an exam appointment less than 72 hours in advance, please notify online-mcs@cs.illinois.edu to ensure your previous attempt in PrairieLearn is cleared and a new exam is available for you.\nGoogle Chrome or Firefox Browser are required to take the exam. \nProctorU Chrome Extension or ProctorU Firefox Extension are required.\nAdditional Resources:\nHow to find and take your exam in PrairieLearn: https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_98sr4m91\nData Structures Proficiency Exam Quick Start Guide\nCITL ProctorU Overview & Requirements\nCITL How to Schedule an Exam with ProctorU\nApply Now\nBecome part of a tradition of excellence: of groundbreaking research, historic firsts, and future promise.\nBegin Undergraduate Application\nBegin Graduate Application"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/admissions/graduate/application-checklist", "data": "HomeAdmissionsGraduate AdmissionsApplication Checklist\nApplication Checklist\nAdmissions Overview\nAdmitted Students\nUndergraduate Admissions\nGraduate Admissions\nApply Now\nDegree & Program Options\nApplication Deadlines\nApplications Process & Requirements\nApplication Checklist\nFAQs\nCheck Application Status\nImpact of an Illinois CS Degree\nFinancial Aid\nAll applicants:\nPhD\nMS in CS\nMS in Bioinformatics\nMaster of Computer Science\nApplication submitted.\n        Application fee paid.\n        Transcripts:  Scan all pages that list the coursework completed.

Please be sure to carefully read the admissions requirement.\nUpdate: In response to the temporary closings of testing centers in countries impacted by COVID-19, the Graduate College will temporarily accept Duolingo English Test examination results for tests taken between February 1, 2020 and August 1, 2024. Please refer to the Graduate College English Proficiency Requirements page for further details.\nInternational applicants whose native language is not English must meet the English Proficiency Requirements for admission for the University of Illinois. Note: Applicants to the online CS degree programs must satisfy requirements for \"Full Status Admission.\"\nInternational applicants are exempt from the TOEFL testing for admissions only if, within five years of the proposed term of enrollment, he or she has completed at least two academic years of full-time study as defined by the home institution, or completed a graduate degree in a country where English is the primary language and in a school where English is the primary language of instruction.\nAll TOEFL test scores should be reported through ETS to Institution Code 1836. A Department code is not needed, however, if one is required, please use \u201c78\u201d.  ( You may upload a scanned PDF copy of the full official score report to your application as \"supplemental material\" until official scores are received.)\nAdditional Information for Online MCS and MCS-DS Applicants\nMCS-DS applicants whose native language is not English and who do not qualify for an English proficiency exemption as described by the University of Illinois Graduate College will be considered for a waiver if they meet BOTH of the following criteria:\nApplicant is currently employed in a country where English is the primary language, as identified on this list.\nApplicant has a minimum of two years of continuous past employment record in a country (or countries) on the list above.\nEligible applicants will be required to submit supporting documentation, sent to the department directly by their employer(s). Documentation indicating the period(s) of employment and location must be sent directly to online-mcs@cs.illinois.edu. If such documentation cannot be provided, applicants must meet the Graduate College English proficiency requirement before the admission process can be finalized. To strengthen their application, these applicants are generally encouraged to submit official scores.\nFinancial Aid Considerations for On-campus Applicants\nIf you have applied to a graduate program (MS in CS, PhD in CS) where departmental financial aid is offered, please note the following:\nTo be eligible for any departmental financial aid, you must submit valid (less than two years old at start of classes) TOEFL iBT or IELTS speak scores regardless of eligibility of waiver for admission requirements.  If currently working on an academic degree in the US or a country whose official native language is English (not medium of instruction), this requirement supersedes the waiver of the TOEFL by the university.\nThis requirement is regardless of naturalized U.S. citizenship or permanent residency. Non-submission of these scores will restrict the department from giving full financial aid considerations.\nTo receive a teaching assistantship, you must meet the requirements detailed here: Proficiency Requirements for Teaching Assistantships.  A passing score on the TOEFL iBT (spoken portion of the exam only) is 24/30. And, a passing score on the IELTS (on the spoken portion of the exam only) is 8.\nSPEAK scores taken on a US campus other than Illinois are not eligible to fulfill the teaching assistantship requirement at Illinois. The department has no authority to waive this requirement. A passing score does not guarantee an assistantship offer.\nApplicants that meet the requirements for teaching assistantships are given preference for admissions, but those with lower speak scores may still be eligible for a research assistantship (RA). Applicants with TOEFL iBT speak scores below 22 have a low chance of admission.\nApply Now\nBecome part of a tradition of excellence: of groundbreaking research, historic firsts, and future promise.\nBegin Undergraduate Application\nBegin Graduate Application"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/admissions/graduate/faqs/ican-faqs", "data": "HomeAdmissionsGraduate AdmissionsFAQsiCAN FAQs\niCAN FAQs\nAdmissions Overview\nAdmitted Students\nUndergraduate Admissions\nGraduate Admissions\nApply Now\nDegree & Program Options\nApplication Deadlines\nApplications Process & Requirements\nApplication Checklist\nFAQs\niCAN FAQs\nOnline MCS FAQs\nCheck Application Status\nImpact of an Illinois CS Degree\nFinancial Aid\nGeneral Questions\n1) What is iCAN?\n2) How long is the iCAN program?\n3) Is iCAN a full-time or part-time program?\n4) Do I need to know how to code in order to apply to the iCAN program?\n5) How much math is required for the iCAN program?\n6) I do not have a background in computer science.

The general FAQ about Illinois Computer Science graduate admissions is located here.\n1) What is the Online MCS?\n2) What is the MCS-DS? \n3) What will appear on the diploma or transcript?\n4) How is the Online MCS offered?\n5) How is an Online MCS course offered using the Coursera platform?\n6) How are Online MCS courses different than typical Coursera MOOC courses?\n7) Do the two Coursera MOOC courses and the high-engagement portion need to be taken concurrently?\n8) I completed a Coursera specialization. Will I earn graduate credit at the University of Illinois?\n9) Are students expected to be proficient in a particular programming language?\n10) How do students apply for the Online MCS or MCS-DS?\n11) What if my undergraduate GPA is less than 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale)?\n12) When do Online MCS classes start?\n13) What classes are offered for the Online MCS program?\n14) Will non-degree graduate students be able to take Online MCS courses?\n15) Is financial aid available for Online MCS students?\n16) Can I defer my admission?\n17) Do international students in these programs receive an I-20?\n18) How can I get more information about the Online MCS and MCS-DS?\n19) I have reviewed all information on the website and have remaining questions. Can I speak with an advisor?\n1) What is the Online MCS?\nThe Online MCS is a professional, non-thesis, Master of Computer Science degree that requires 32 credit hours of coursework. Students can complete the eight courses required for the Online MCS at their own pace, in as little as one year or as many as five years. Students receive lectures through the Coursera platform, but are advised and assessed by Illinois faculty and teaching assistants on a rigorous set of assignments, projects, and exams required for university degree credit.\n2) What is the MCS-DS?\nThe MCS-DS is a focused track of the Online MCS whose requirements are fulfilled by courses in Data Science. A professional coursework-based degree program, the MCS-DS builds expertise in core areas of computer science like data mining, machine learning, cloud computing, and data visualization, in addition to building skills in statistics and information science.\n3) What will appear on the diploma or transcript?\nThe coursework for both the Online MCS and the MCS-DS track satisfies the requirements for our Master of Computer Science degree, so the diploma and the transcripts will only indicate \u201cMaster of Computer Science\u201d. (They will not mention the online mode of delivery, or, for MCS-DS, data science.)\n4) How is the Online MCS offered?\nThe Online MCS is a 100% online degree offered through the Coursera platform. To satisfy the degree requirements, students will complete 8 University of Illinois credit-bearing courses, with each course representing 4 credit hours (for a total of 32 credit hours). Each MCS/MCS-DS credit-bearing course is offered on a semester schedule (fall, spring, summer). Each course may run as long as the full 15 weeks available in a semester, though some courses may be shorter.\n5) How is an Online MCS course offered using the Coursera platform?\nEach credit-bearing semester-based Online MCS course consists of two shorter 4-6 week Coursera MOOC courses plus additional credit-bearing components such as exams and/or projects. The two Coursera MOOC courses provide the lecture and lesson videos of the Online MCS course, as well as peer and auto graded quizzes and assignments.\n6) How are Online MCS courses different than typical Coursera MOOC courses?\nOnline MCS courses are credit bearing courses.  University of Illinois faculty and staff provide guidance, advice, feedback, and grade assignments, projects, and exams submitted by students registered for University of Illinois credit. MOOC courses are not graded and do not count for University of Illinois credit.\n7) Do the two Coursera MOOC courses need to be taken concurrently with the for-credit portion of an Online MCS course?\nThis is not required, but we do recommend they all be taken concurrently. A student can complete one or both Coursera MOOC courses prior to completing the Online MCS for-credit course. Any assignment that was only peer or auto-graded for a previous Coursera MOOC version of a course can be re-submitted when taking the Online MCS offering of the course for consideration by the faculty and staff to satisfy the requirements to confer university credit.  However, for-credit course content may be revised and updated for course improvement, making previously completed MOOC assignments no longer compatible with the degree requirements.  In such instances, students will be required to complete the current assignments to fulfill requirements for the for-credit course they are enrolled.\n8) I completed a Coursera specialization. Will I earn graduate credit at the University of Illinois?\nCompletion of Coursera MOOC courses/specializations associated with the Online MCS program by itself will not earn graduate credits from the university toward the degree. Students must be registered in the University of Illinois credit-bearing semester-based Online MCS courses to earn graduate credit.\n9) Are students expected to be proficient in a particular programming language?\nStudents are expected to be proficient computer programmers to be admitted to any Master of Computer Science program. At the Masters level, students are expected to learn new programming languages on their own as needed, to develop the skill of using the appropriate programming tool to solve a particular problem.\nEach of the courses will have specific programming language requirements. Applied Machine Learning requires students to be proficient in the R programming language, whereas Statistical Programming in R is also based on the R programming language but provides an introduction to it. Cloud Computing Concepts requires students to be proficient in C++ programming to write low-level kernel functions, whereas Text Information Systems requires students understand enough C++ for high-level scripting calls of library functions that perform the low-level operations. Cloud Computing Applications can be completed using Python, but Java is encouraged as it is the primary language used for production cloud application programming. Data Visualization uses JavaScript programming, but provides students with tutorials and time to learn JavaScript before it is used in the course. Many of the other courses use higher level scripting languages like Python.\n10) How do students apply for the Online MCS or MCS-DS?\nTo apply to the Online MCS or MCS-DS, please complete an application here. Application deadlines are found here. \n11) What if my undergraduate GPA is less than 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale)?\nUniversity campus policy requires a GPA of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) for the last two years of undergraduate study for admission to any graduate program, but students admitted for the MCS degree typically have a GPA in excess of 3.2. The admissions committee will review applications with borderline GPAs which otherwise have a record of exceptional achievements. However, the likelihood of applicants with a GPA less than 3.0 being admitted to the MCS/MCS-DS program is expected to be low due to the competitiveness of the applicant pool and cohort size. Applicants who do not meet the minimum GPA requirements for this program are encouraged to make a realistic self-assessment before submitting an application.\n12) When do Online MCS classes start?\nOnline MCS classes follow the standard academic calendar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n13) What classes are offered for the Online MCS and MCS-DS?\nA list of courses for the Online MCS is available here. A list of courses for the MCS-DS is available here.\n14) Will non-degree graduate students be able to take Online MCS courses?\nOnline MCS courses can be taken by non-degree students, but registration will be limited to the remaining capacity after Online MCS students have been registered.\n15) Is financial aid available for Online MCS or MCS-DS students?\nIllinois Computer Science does not offer research or teaching assistantships to students enrolled in our online programs, including the Online MCS and MCS-DS. Domestic students may qualify for Federal Student Aid.\n16) Can I defer my admission?\nYes, admission can be deferred up to three consecutive semesters (i.e. Fall, Spring, Summer). Beginning with Fall 2023 admissions, a one-time non-refundable deferral deposit of $750.00 is required to defer. The deferral deposit will be applied to tuition charges when a student enrolls. Students who select to defer but do not submit payment of the deferral deposit by the deadline forfeit their admission and the student enrollment decision will be updated to \"I decline my offer of admission\".\nDeferral deposit deadlines for each term of admission are: FALL - August 5; SPRING - December 20; SUMMER - April 20. \n17) Do international students in this program receive an I-20?\nNo. All requirements in the MCS/MCS-DS program are satisfied online. Students are not required to arrive on campus to meet any degree requirements. As such, no I-20s are issued.\n18) How can I get more information about the Online MCS and MCS-DS?\nSign up for updates by completing Coursera's Interest Form for the Online MCS or the separate Form for the MCS-DS. For specific questions about the Illinois degree options, email online-mcs@cs.illinois.edu.\n19) I have reviewed all information on the website and have remaining questions.

Following the instructions in the email, look for your Time Ticket (earliest registration time) on Student Self Service. Once the time stated on your time ticket comes up, you can start registering for your courses.\nWhen is the soonest that I can register? When can I see my Time Ticket?\nBesides sending you an email about your Time Ticket, the Office of the Registrar has a page about Time Tickets that may be helpful.\nWhat happens if I wait until a few weeks or months after my Time Ticket to register?\nIf you wait, you may be unable to register for the courses required to keep you on track to graduate! Some necessary CS courses have been filling up the last few semesters, so we're trying to help you by restricting registration in many of our core courses (CS 126, CS 173, CS 210, CS 225, CS 233, CS 241, CS 242, CS 357, CS 374 and most 400-level CS electives) to specific majors. We lift the restrictions from many of those courses the Monday after early registration ends. If you haven't registered by then and find that you can't get into the class you need, you will probably be out of luck. You will have to register for the CS electives that are available.\nWhat if I have a hold and cannot register during my Time Ticket?\nIf you have a hold for any reason that restricts your registration ability, let an advisor know ASAP (before registration begins, if possible). They will work with you as much as possible to have a seat for you in your required courses.\nRegistration Checklist\nMeet with your advisor for any questions about registration. First-year students are required to meet with an academic advisor in the fall. All undergrads in the CS department are required to meet with their faculty mentor before registration in the spring.\nClear any registration holds you may have.\nMake yourself aware of Enrollment Restrictions.\nRegister for a complete schedule at full-time status. If you underload your schedule, it must be approved.\nVerify your address.\nif you are registering for your final semester, you must complete graduation information and add yourself to the pending degree list.\nHow to Use the Online Registration System\nRegistration is done online through the Student Self-Service system. The Office of the Registrar has a video with step-by-step instructions on how to use the system. (That page also contains written instructions.) Their pages on Registration Procedures and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) also contain helpful information.\nPlanning for Next Semester and the Future\nWhich courses should I register for?\nThis depends on (1) which courses are required for you to complete your degree, (2) which requirements you have already completed, (3) when a course is usually offered, and (4) which courses you might be interested in taking.\nDegree Requirements\nRequirements fall into three general categories:\nMajor requirements: courses required for your specific major - these are spelled out for each CS major: CS in The Grainger College of Engineering, Mathematics & CS, Statistics & CS, and CS + X.\nGeneral education requirements: to ensure your degree program is well-rounded - see the Engineering advising website for Engineering gen eds and the LAS website for LAS-specific gen eds.\nFree electives: additional coursework to bring your credit hours up to the required minimum for graduation - Engineering students, be sure to check the Engineering free electives web page for courses that do not count.\nProgress on Degree Requirements\nYou can follow your progress through your requirements using two main tools:\nCheck the requirements flowchart for your major for the suggested order in which major requirements should be taken, or use one of the course planning forms. (CS in The Grainger College of Engineering, Mathematics & CS, Statistics & CS, CS + X - see your X department for their requirements).\nBy checking your degree audit, see what requirements you have completed/are completing and have left to complete. You can access your degree audit on the web-based Degree Audit System (DARS). The Registrar's Office website has a step-by-step procedure for running a DARS Audit.\nIf you have a concern about your DARS (for example, if you have taken a course that you think should satisfy a requirement but it is not being counted), please email undergrad@cs.illinois.edu.\nIf your situation is not straightforward or you're struggling in your courses, you should talk to an advisor, Steve Herzog, Heather Zike, Katrina James, or Elizabeth Gonzalez, before registering for your courses. If you're struggling, that might be a sign that you need to take fewer hours or fewer technical hours. If you're wondering if your proposed course schedule is manageable, ask your peers \u2013 and don't be afraid to get more than one opinion.\nCourse Offerings\nWhen drawing up your schedule, pay close attention to course offering patterns to avoid overloads! Some courses are offered in fall or spring only. If you're within two or fewer semesters of graduating, plan out the rest of your courses carefully so you don't need a course not offered the semester you intend to graduate. We anticipate this might be a problem, particularly for CS in Engineering majors who plan on completing the two-course Software Engineering or Senior Project sequence and/or certain focus groups. This also applies to Mathematics & CS and Statistics & CS majors looking to complete certain required courses at the junior and senior levels.\nInformation about individual courses\nHow do you discover what a course covers, if it is being offered, or if an elective might be helpful or interesting to you?\nThere are several critical sources of information:\nThe CS website. https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses (Provides a short overview of each CS course, plus Learning Goals.)\nThe Course Explorer. https://courses.illinois.edu/ (Provides the schedule of all University courses by term and a browsable database of general education requirements, in addition to other resources.)\nThe official Course Catalog and Programs of Study.\nMany instructors maintain course websites, which may be helpful to visit when determining if a course is right for you.\nStudent-run resources like Dr. Everitt's Neighborhood.\nConsider a CS 498 Special Topics in CS course!\nMany faculty offer a CS 498 Special Topics in CS course, which tend to be small classes, focused on a topic close to a faculty member's heart and thus provide an excellent opportunity for a letter of recommendation and a future project or thesis. And you can use them to satisfy your 400-level CS elective requirements. For more information, including meeting times, course descriptions, and prerequisites, see the course (https://courses.illinois.edu/) and search for CS 498 to see the titles of courses offered.  Some current and past CS 498 Special Topics (others may be added):\nVirtual Reality\nDigital Forensics\nApplied Machine Learning\nIntro to Data Science\nThe Art of Web Programming\nAlgorithms for Big Data\nInternet of Things\nRegistration Advising, Faculty Mentors, & Piazza\nSeeking Advice\nWho is my advisor?\nAll undergraduates in the Computer Science department (students in any major with the words \"Computer Science\" in the title) are assigned a CS advisor.  If you have ANY questions about requirements, policies, and procedures, you can make an appointment to meet with your CS academic advisor or email your advisor.  Students not in a Computer Science major can seek advice during drop-in advising hours in the CS Academic Office at 1312 Siebel Center or by emailing undergrad@cs.illinois.edu. Advisors are usually on duty during drop-in advising hours (listed here). You can check to make sure - the drop-in advising hours are usually posted right by the door to the Academic Office.\nAm I required to meet with an advisor before I register?\nFirst-year students are required to meet with their CS academic advisor during the fall (you will be emailed about this requirement).  All CS undergrads are required to meet with their faculty mentor (see below), usually in the spring semester, to be eligible to register for the upcoming fall. If you have questions about scheduling, requirements, and procedures, you should see an advisor in the Academic Office or email undergrad@cs.illinois.edu.\nCan an advisor get me into a closed class?\nHaving a backup course on your schedule is always best if your first choice is unavailable at registration time. Advisors usually cannot add you to a closed course, but here are some suggestions:\nCheck the class schedule. Read the course notes and check to see if a new section of the course may be added.\nKeep trying. Someone will probably drop the course, so check frequently to see if someone does. Persistence is the key to getting the classes you want.\nCall or stop by the department offering the course to ask:\nIs there any way I can schedule this course?\nAre additional sections likely to be added? If so, when?\nIs there a waiting list? If so, can I add my name to it? (CS does not usually have a waitlist for courses.)\nExpect to make changes during breaks or when you return to campus. Many students do not leave for winter and summer breaks with class schedules finalized.\nSchedule a related course that would be a good alternative. That being said, don\u2019t settle for courses that are not appropriate just because they are available.\nTry again during peak schedule change times. Right before classes start and during the first 10 days of the semester, people frequently change their schedules.\nAttend the first day of class and ask the instructor if you can register for the course. The instructor may tell you no; however, he or she may tell you yes if attendance is low during the first week and it appears that there might be room in the course.\nIf you can\u2019t add the class right away, ask the instructor if you can attend the class in the meantime. That way, you will be sure you want the course and will not have missed anything if the course becomes available.\nFaculty Mentors\nAll CS undergrads are assigned a faculty mentor (new students receive their assignments usually late in their first fall semester or early in their first spring semester). Typically, all undergraduates must meet with their faculty mentor by the beginning of April (early registration for summer and fall terms). If you have a question that a faculty member would be best equipped to answer, feel free to contact your mentor or any professor you've met with before or have had a course with in a past semester. Or if you have a question about a certain area of computer science, you can find which faculty members specialize in that particular area. All our faculty members are listed by research area and alphabetically on the CS website. You can find these listings and contact information for each faculty member in the CS departmental faculty directory. To understand more about faculty mentors and the advising process, see the Computer Science Undergraduate Advising page.\nPIAZZA\nCS is using Piazza as a forum for students to get advice from their peers and the Office of Undergraduate Programs. Many questions can be answered quickly when we pool our shared knowledge.\nFor simple advising questions, feel free to post to Piazza; CS staff will be monitoring and answering as best and as quickly as we can. This may save you a trip to our office (though we'd still like to see you - don't be a stranger!).\nHere are some suggestions, guidelines, and comments about this service:\nUse this forum to ask your peers questions about courses, sanity-checking schedules, internships, etc.\nUse this forum for simple questions about department, college, and university policies.\nDon't post academically sensitive information (e.g., grades, etc.) unless you post anonymously.\nWe've disabled private posts because such a post usually indicates that you should probably be coming in to see an advisor or the Director of Undergraduate Programs in person.\nHow to sign up for the advising Piazza: https://piazza.com/configure-classes/other/csadvising\nLink to the Advising Piazza \"course\" page: https://piazza.com/illinois/other/csadvising/home\nPrepare for Graduation\nCheck your DARS to ensure you know your remaining requirements and that you can fit them into your remaining semesters. For help, contact a CS academic advisor.\nMake sure you'll reach the required total hours minimum. See DARS for this, and remember that DARS includes in-progress courses - anything you're currently taking this semester and anything you've registered for next semester - in the total hours!\nDon't forget free electives! CS in Engineering majors need 128 total hours to graduate; all CS undergraduates in LAS need 120 hours. Just fulfilling your major requirements and gen eds will not be enough. Engineering majors, check the Engineering advising web page on free electives to see which courses DO NOT count toward your total graduation hours.\nIf you have any time conflicts among the remaining required courses, email the CS undergraduate advisors as soon as possible and let them know which courses are conflicting.\nDeclare your intent to graduate. You should do this through Student Self-Service when you register for your final semester of courses. Click on the tab \"Graduation Information\" to ensure the term is set at the term you are graduating, then follow the instructions to declare your intent to graduate.\nReview this Graduation page from the Office of the Registrar to ensure you complete all the essential steps for graduation.\nComplete commencement information can be found at http://commencement.illinois.edu/.\nRegistration Error Messages\nThe following error messages are commonly received during registration. Learn what they mean and what to do when you receive them. It may be helpful to read the course notes in the course explorer under the specific CRN (course reference number) you are attempting to add to your schedule.\nClass Restriction\nThe class is being held for students at a particular class standing (i.e., freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors). Try to add another section of the class. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.\nClosed or Reserved\nThe class is being held for students in a particular program or major. Try to add another section of the class. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.\nCollege Restriction\nThe class is being held for students in a particular college. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.\nCORQ Error\nSome classes require that you also register for a co-requisite or attached course. If you get this error, the error message will tell you the class and CRN you need to add. Type both CRNs in the boxes at the bottom of the add/drop screen and try again.\nDepartmental Approval Required\nThe department has restricted the course. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted. Otherwise, contact the department for more information.\nLink Error\nSpecific lecture sections must be linked to a lab or discussion section. The lecture, discussion, or lab must start with the same letter (A, B, etc.).\nFor example, I want to register for SOC 100. I need a lecture (AL1) and discussion section (ADA or ADF). If I do not have the lecture and discussion section selected, or if I register for a BL1 lecture and an ADA discussion, I will get this error.\nMajor Restriction\nThis class is being held for students in a particular major(s). Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.\nProgram Restriction\nThis course is restricted to a particular program or major. Check the class schedule to see if the department has posted when the restriction will be lifted.\nStudent Attribute Restriction / PREQ or Test Score Error\nYou get one of these messages when you don\u2019t have an attribute required of the course or section. Check the section restrictions in the class schedule. Most often, courses are held in this fashion for freshmen, James Scholars, pre-College of Media students, Weston or Allen Hall students, and so on.\nThese sections will not open to other students unless otherwise noted, so if possible, try to add another unrestricted section of the class.\nTime Conflict With (CRN)\nYou will get this message when the time of the course you try to add conflicts with another course. Check to see if the course conflicts with either a discussion or lecture, and try to change the previous or new course to a different time."}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/cs-undergraduate-degree-options-faq", "data": "HomeAcademicsUndergraduate AcademicsDegree & Program OptionsCS Undergraduate Degree Option...\nCS Undergraduate Degree Options FAQ\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nDegree & Program Options\nB.S. in Computer Science\nB.S. in Mathematics & Computer Science\nB.S. in Statistics & Computer Science\nCS Minor\nCS + X Degree Programs\nCS Undergraduate Degree Options FAQ\nRegistration\nPolicies and Procedures\nUndergraduate Advising\nCS Student Opportunity Series (CS SOS)\nUndergraduate Forms\nHonors\nTransfer Students\nGraduate Academics\nCourses\nHonor Code\nStudent Resources\nUndergraduate CS and Blended Degree Programs FAQ\nHere are many of the frequently asked questions \u2013 and answers! \u2013 about the computing-related degree options at Illinois:\nGeneral Information\nHow many undergraduate CS, blended CS, or blended Data Science degree programs are there, and what's the difference between them? \nWith so many options, how do you choose which computing-related major to apply for?\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the Computer Science (CS) major and the Computer Engineering (CE) major from The Grainger College of Engineering?\nHow does the coursework differ between the CS major from The Grainger College of Engineering, the blended CS + X majors, and the X + Data Science majors?\nDo the blended programs (Mathematics & CS, Statistics & CS, CS + X or X + Data Science) result in a dual degree?\nWhat computer languages are taught in required CS courses at Illinois?\nWhat kinds of employment opportunities do the various CS programs prepare students for?\nWhat career fields are common for the blended CS majors? \n\nAdmissions\nHow competitive are admissions to the CS major in The Grainger College of Engineering? \nIs it easier to be admitted to the blended majors (Mathematics & CS, Statistics & CS, CS + X or X + Data Science) than the CS major in engineering?\nIf I\u2019m admitted to another department at Illinois, can I transfer into a computing-related major?\nIf I\u2019m in another department on campus can I apply for a second bachelor\u2019s degree in a CS program?\nWhat are the benefits of the CS minor, and how do I apply?\nIf you have questions about undergraduate CS and blended degree programs that this FAQ page has not addressed, please email  undergrad@cs.illinois.edu and an academic advisor will respond to your inquiry.

Stop by, call or email. Also see: Feedback or Report a problem\nFaculty Mentors\nAll students are assigned a faculty mentor, with whom they must meet at least once each academic year, typically before April. The department enforces this requirement with a registration hold. You can find your faculty mentor and schedule appointments with him or her on my.cs.illinois.edu.\nFaculty mentors can:\nBe an advisor on general methods of connecting with other faculty beyond the classroom setting.\nHelp you map out the field of computer science and explain its various areas of specialization\nBased on your strengths and interests, help you sort out which area of computer science you might specialize in\nSuggest courses to take, especially CS technical electives, based on your goals and interests\nProvide information about possible career paths\nProvide information on research opportunities\nProvide information on graduate school\nProvide a letter of recommendation - if you get to know a faculty member well enough and demonstrate strong ability in their courses, that is.\nYou should not necessarily expect faculty mentors to help you with the following:\nAnswer detailed or complicated questions about degree requirements or university policies (these should be forwarded to your assigned CS advisor)\nSelect general education electives\nTell you which courses are \"easier\" than others (ask peer advisors or other students)\nDetermine how transfer and AP courses count towards graduation requirements (instructions for this are posted on the policies and procedures page of the CS website)\nAdd or drop a class for students (instructions for this are posted on the policies and procedures page of the CS website),\nGet students out of academic troubles (students who are struggling should contact their assigned CS academic advisor as soon as possible for options and advice).\nIn addition to meeting with your faculty mentor, you should feel free to meet with other faculty, such as those with whom you've had classes you've enjoyed, or those from a research area that is of interest to you.

Most are now full by the beginning of each semester. While the Computer Science Department sincerely wishes to give students from across campus the opportunity to take CS courses, we have to ensure that students who are specifically required to take these courses can do so when they need them in order to graduate. For that reason, we have been restricting enrollment for many of our courses during the early registration period each term and capping enrollments below maximum capacity in order to save seats for incoming Computer Science students and those who find out at the last minute that they need a certain course. The Current Registration Restrictions, linked below, lists our restrictions for the most immediate term, and indicates if/when we might release those restrictions, and if/when we might release any seats we have held back for various reasons.  Note that as we work to ensure as many seats as is practical for certain courses, we might move courses into different (usually larger) rooms well after early registration has begun. If we are able to add seats or sections to a course after major restrictions have been lifted, the CS department reserves the right to temporarily place major and program restrictions back on these sections to allow CS major and Engineering tuition students the ability to make changes to their schedules. The dates these restrictions will be removed will be shared on the CS Undergraduate Advising Piazza.\nClick here -> Current Registration Restrictions\nComputer Science Course Restrictions for Fall 2023\n  Students should follow our Undergraduate Advising PIAZZA: piazza.com/illinois/other/csadvising\nPiazza is the location where the department will announce if there are additional seats being released on a day not specified within this document.\n   **Starting Fall 2022, prerequisites will be enforced for nearly all undergraduate sections of 400-level CS courses. Plan accordingly.\nSome seats will be reserved for incoming graduate, first year, and transfer students.  The instructor and advisors cannot give an override for these reserved seats. \nIf a section says \"Closed,\" it is full at that time and we will not be providing overrides even if Enterprise lists remaining seats.  Many CS courses have multiple sections/crosslists, which share all of the seats for the entire course.  If one section says there are remaining seats, those seats are likely occupied by students in another section.   To know actual seats remaining in a cross-listed course, you must look at the XL remaining number in Enterprise (Self-Service).\nFor online sections you must read the course notes in Enterprise/Course Explorer or the online UIUC class schedule to find out if you are eligible to register for the section. (This includes City Scholar sections) https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule\nThe CS Academic Office will not create or manage wait-lists.\nStudents in CS majors have specific sections to register for in CS 124, 128, 173, 225, & 233. All other students must register for the non-major sections, no exceptions. \nFor CS students to register for a CS 397 Individual Study, CS 497 Team Project or CS 499 Senior Thesis go to the following link and complete the form after speaking with faculty:  https://my.cs.illinois.edu/IndStudy.\nIf registering for CS 397, CS 497, or CS 499, be sure your credit hours are correct! If they are not, students can change the credit hour in the registration system before the add deadline. Email undergrad@cs.illinois.edu for assistance, if needed.\nAdditional information about CS 397, CS 497, and CS 499 approval is under the policies & procedures page here: https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/policies-and-procedures.\nCS 400-level courses (unless otherwise listed) If the course is cross-listed with another department the CS Section will be restricted to students in CS programs and the cross-listed section to those within the other department, until restrictions are lifted.\nGrad-level courses for undergrads:  If the course has both a 3- & 4-hour sections, 4-hour sections are generally restricted to graduate-level students.  Any undergraduate wanting the graduate-level 4-hour section or a 500-level course must receive approval from the instructor and department.  To obtain this, students complete the following petition Undergrad Application for Access to CS Grad Sections: https://my.cs.illinois.edu/ugpetitions/. To be fully approved to register a graduate course or section, students need approval from the course instructor and from the CS department. Because graduate students often register later, the CS department will not begin reviewing submitted requests until 3 weeks prior to the start of the semester, at the earliest. Requests should be submitted the Thursday before classes begin and anything after will be subject to delays and possibly a late course change (add/drop) form.  You must complete the petition for any consideration into a grad level CS course.  If the course has an undergraduate section you must have a seat in the undergrad section until the department reviews the requests.  If the course is filled with graduate students and the course sections appear \"Closed,\" the class is full to capacity and we cannot add more students. Instructor approval does not guarantee department approval. If you are requesting access to a graduate section of a summer course, please email instructor approval directly to egon@illinois.edu before the start of the summer term for full consideration.\nOverlapping courses (Time conflict): Enterprise will not let students register for classes with meeting times that overlap. However, the CS Undergraduate Advising Office can provide an override if at least one of the courses is a CS course. To get an override for a CS course (plan to miss a CS course lecture), students must submit a \u2018Time Conflict\u2019 request in the CS petitions portal: https://my.cs.illinois.edu/ugpetitions. The form will be sent to the instructor for the following approvals: 1) the instructor is OK with the student missing class time 2) the instructor is willing to provide a conflict examination if the course overlap results in two final exams scheduled at the same time. Once the instructor approves in the portal, the request will be reviewed by the CS department. Starting for Spring 2023 registration, all time conflict requests for CS courses will need to be submitted in the CS petitions portal. The CS Department will not enter time conflict overrides unless it is a CS course the student plans to miss and a CS instructor who approves the absences (and potential conflict exam). If it is a non-CS course the student plans to miss, the student must seek a time-conflict override from the other course instructor and the department controlling the other course. Students will be notified of decisions within the petition portal (and via automated email). Requests will be reviewed on a rolling basis.  If you are granted the time conflict override, it is your responsibility to understand the expectations and consequences of missing scheduled lectures and keeping up with the missed content.\nAutomatic Prerequisite Enforcement:  We will continue to enforce prerequisites for our 100-, 200- and 300-level coursework as we have for the past few semesters.  We will also now be enforcing prerequisites on many 400-level CS electives for undergraduates, as well.  Students who have transfer or proficiency credit that is not yet in the system should fill out a prerequisite override request, providing evidence of their credit.  Students who have permission from an instructor to meet a prerequisite that they don\u2019t have credit for will need to include an email from the instructor or screenshot to document that permission.\nYou will not be granted an override for missing coursework used for a previous prerequisite override.\n  GRAD STUDENTS\nCS GRAD STUDENTS: Most CS 400-level classes are now available to register for 3 or 4 credit hours, if the 3 credit option is available for graduate students. Review info on Registrar page for updating variable credit hours (https://registrar.illinois.edu/registration/registration-process/variable-credit-hours/). CS 498 courses will have separate sections for 3 (if available) and 4 credit hours.\nNon-CS GRADS:  CS will open GRAD seats to all GRADS on July 31st for Fall 2023 courses.\nNon-CS GRAD students wanting 100, 200, or 300 level CS courses must submit a request here: https://go.cs.illinois.edu/FA23GradAccess. Any request submitted after 9 am on the 10th day (the add deadline) will not be reviewed/approved for the current semester. If you are requesting access to a 100, 200, or 300 level CS course for Summer semester, please email the course number and your UIN directly to egon@illinois.edu before the start of the summer term for full consideration.\nCOURSES OFFERED ON COURSERA\nRead this Important Information on how to access your CS Course Hosted on Coursera \nFA23 Courses offered on Coursera available to on-campus students include:\nCS 410 Text Information Systems\nCS 418/CSE 427 Interactive Computer Graphics \nCS 427/CSE 426 Software Engineering I\nCS 441 Applied Machine Learning\nCS 447 Natural Language Processing\nSU23 Courses offered on Coursera available to on-campus students include:\nCS 416 Data Visualization\nCS 421 Programming Languages & Compilers\nCS 519 Scientific Visualization (Graduate Students)\n**Courses offered in the Coursera platform cannot be added (section changed) after the 10 day add deadline."}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/policies-and-procedures", "data": "HomeAcademicsUndergraduate AcademicsPolicies and Procedures\nPolicies and Procedures\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nDegree & Program Options\nRegistration\nPolicies and Procedures\nUndergraduate Advising\nCS Student Opportunity Series (CS SOS)\nUndergraduate Forms\nHonors\nTransfer Students\nGraduate Academics\nCourses\nHonor Code\nStudent Resources\nThe list below addresses the undergraduate policy and procedure questions that the CS Office of Undergraduate Programs encounters most frequently.

If you think that you should have received AP credit but did not, check with your college office or contact The College Board to request that your AP scores be sent to Illinois.\nCredit/No Credit (a.k.a. pass/fail)\nThe Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) option allows students to take a course without having it count toward their GPA. CR/NC is intended to encourage students to explore academic subjects they might not otherwise consider for fear of harming their GPA. Before you consider taking a course CR/NC, read the following very carefully. You should also consult the specific guidelines set down by your college.\nYou may not select the CR/NC option for any course that will fulfill a requirement (this includes campus general education requirements - though Engineering students may take the \"additional six hours\" of college general education requirements CR/NC).\nYou may take free electives CR/NC, but not technical electives. For an explanation of the difference between free and technical electives see the section on Electives.\nYou may select the CR/NC option only up to the half-way point of the term (same as drop-deadline).\nYou may take a maximum of two courses CR/NC during a semester (only one during a summer term) - up to 18 hours maximum for your undergraduate career.\nCS students are particularly discouraged from taking CS courses CR/NC - even courses that are not needed to fulfill requirements - because graduate schools do not look favorably upon it and neither do some potential employers. Normally, a request to take a CS course CR/NC will be denied.\nYour instructor will not know that you have chosen the CR/NC option and will assign a letter grade. A C- or better will automatically be changed to CR. A D+ or worse will automatically result in NC.\nProcedure: To take a course CR/NC, you must fill out a form (available in CS Office of Undergraduate Programs or in your college's office), obtain a signature from the CS Office of Undergraduate Programs, and take the signed form to your college office. You may revert back to a letter grade using the same form and procedure, but you must do so before the half-way point of the course.\nConflict Examinations\nIf your schedule results in three final exams within a 24-hour period, you may request to take a conflict examination at another time for one of the courses. University policy holds that a course giving a combined exam (i.e. multiple lecture sections with one exam) must give the conflict exam if conflicting with a non-combined course. If none of the courses in question are combined, then the largest class (most students) must offer the conflict exam.\nDropping and adding classes\nStudents may drop and add classes by themselves on Enterprise Student Self-Service, as long as they do so within the registration time frame as outlined on the Registrar's Office website: calendar of academic and financial deadlines. Before you drop or add a class, however, please carefully read the following guidelines and restrictions.\nAdding classes\nYou may add a full-semester class within the first 10 day deadline of the semester. However, it is encouraged to sign up for classes well before if you can; the closer you get to the 10th day, the more instruction and assignments you may have missed. Instructors are not obligated to make accommodations for grading or accepting late assignments due to anything you have missed.\nFor Independent study courses, the department will approve late adds until the last day of instruction for the term. However, we advise students to complete the late registration process ASAP to avoid delays and to ensure credit is accurately reflected on their record. Follow the late-add procedures for your college of enrollment.\nFor 100-300 level courses, late adding a CS course is not generally approved. If there are extraordinary circumstances that prevented you from registering on time for the course, please consult with your CS advisor, CS Express Advising, or email undergrad@cs.illinois.edu to request a late add.\nFor 400 level courses, the CS Undergraduate Academic Office will review late add requests up until the end of the 4th week of the semester. In general, students should not be far behind in the course, should have a plan for getting caught up in the course, and should have approval in writing (email is acceptable) from the instructor of the course. Note that instructors are not obligated to make accommodations for grading or accepting late assignments due to late adding a course. To begin the late add process, CS majors should follow up with their assigned advisors. Non majors can visit CS Express Advising or email undergrad@cs.illinois.edu. Students should also begin the late registration change process as outlined by their college (see \u201cCollege Resources\u201d below).\nAfter the 4th week of the semester, late adding 400 level courses will generally not be approved unless there are extraordinary circumstances that prevented you from registering on time for the course, please consult with your CS advisor, CS Express Advising, or email undergrad@cs.illinois.edu to request a late add.\nCredit hour and sections changes after the add-deadline\nFor courses that have a 3 and 4 credit hour option (i.e. CS 400\u2013level electives with a grad and undergrad section) or other variable credit courses such as independent study, after the add-deadline, students can request a credit hour change up to the drop deadline for full term courses. The department will not approve credit hour changes after the 8 week drop deadline. Students will request the credit hour change through their college\u2019s late registration change process (see links below). Students can email their request form to undergrad@cs.illinois.edu, or bring it to their advisor for approval. The CS academic office will not approve credit hour changes without approval from the instructor. If the instructor did not sign the late change form, you can forward the instructor approval via email or submit other documentation along with your late change form for the office to review.\nFor cases where a student wishes to late change sections of a course (i.e. switch from the \u201cA\u201d lecture to the \u201cB\u201d lecture or changing discussion sections within a linked lecture), the CS Academic Office will review those requests until the last day of instruction. Students should have approval in writing (email is acceptable) from the instructor(s) of the course that coursework completed in the original section can be transferred to the new section. Students will request the section change through their college\u2019s late registration change process (see links below). Students can email their request form to undergrad@cs.illinois.edu, or bring it to their advisor for approval. \nDropping classes\nYou may drop a full-semester class prior to or on the 8 week drop-deadline during fall and spring semesters and drop deadline as outlined by the Registrar's office for summer term. The CS Department advises majors to connect with their assigned advisor before dropping a course to ensure it will be in your best interest.\nDropping a course after the drop deadline is not normally allowed without extenuating circumstances and requires permission from the student\u2019s college office. Extenuating circumstances may include an extended illness or incapacitating injury, the death of a family member, or the discovery and diagnosis of a learning disability or mental health disorder. All of these must be properly documented to warrant a late drop. Dissatisfaction with your grade in a course is not a legitimate justification for a late drop. In conjunction with your college academic office, we encourage CS majors to work with your CS advisor to explore if there are any options for you after the drop-deadline.\nA late drop may result in a \"W\" (withdrawal) being listed in the grade column for the course on your transcript.\nYou must receive permission from your college office to drop below 12 hours (full-time status) during the spring and fall semesters. Unless it is your last semester before graduation, permission is granted only under certain conditions (chronic illness, for example). There is no minimum hours requirement for the summer terms.  International students will also need further approval from ISSS. Please follow up with your college academic office (and ISSS if needed) regarding requests for underloading.\nCollege Resources (Late Course Change forms and processes)\nCollege of Engineering\nCollege of Liberal Arts and Sciences\nCollege of Media\nCollege of Agriculture, Consumer and Environmental Sciences\nCollege of Education\nOther colleges, please follow up with your college academic office\nIf you have any questions about whether you can drop or add a course, contact your advisor or undergrad@cs.illinois.edu.\nElectives\nGenerally speaking, CS majors (in Engineering) have two types of electives, technical electives and free electives. Students must choose technical electives from a set of courses approved by the department. Almost any course on campus can be used for free elective credits. There are some restrictions (e.g. on the number of physical education courses you can take). For more information on these restrictions, please check the specific regulations on electives for your college (LAS students, College of Engineering students), while most Engineering students can find an explanation of their Language Other Than English (LOTE) requirement here.\nFor international students who are not native speakers of English, the requirement can be more complicated. International students in LAS must have completed 4 yrs of their native language and English in a Senior Secondary School (grades 9, 10, 11, and 12). Students who did not complete 4 years of either English or their native language can take the proficiency exam in their native language through the 4th level at UIUC to waive the language other than English requirement.\nIn the College of Engineering, international students must have completed 3 years of their native language and English in a Senior Secondary School (grades 9, 10, 11, or 12). Students who did not complete 3 years can take the proficiency exam through the 3rd level at UIUC to waive the Language Other Than English (LOTE) requirement. (This requirement applies to student who started school in Fall 2000 or later.)\nGrade Replacement\nUndergraduate students at the University of Illinois may take a limited number of courses under certain circumstances and have the grade from the first time taking the course removed from GPA calculations. Before retaking a course and assuming that grade replacement can be applied, READ THE UNIVERSITY'S GRADE REPLACEMENT POLICY AND THE PROCEDURES FOR YOUR COLLEGE CAREFULLY.\nThe university's grade replacement policy is spelled out in the Student Code.\nCS majors in the College of Engineering should consult the Engineering advising site on Grade Replacement for procedures.\nCS majors in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences should consult the LAS advising site and Sciences for the grade replacement procedures they should follow.\nNote that students may retake a class, regardless of whether they apply grade replacement or not, at any time.\nPolicy on Grading\nStudents have a right to be given assignments that are well-prepared and of appropriate length, and to have them graded in a timely fashion. Furthermore, knowing how the class will be graded, and where they stand, can reduce students' anxiety and promote learning.\nStudents can expect the following grading policy to be followed, unless instructors explicitly say otherwise.\nTimeliness\nGrading of mid-term exams\nIf at all possible, the first mid-term should be given, graded, and returned prior to the undergraduate drop date.\nMid-term exams should be graded and returned within two weeks, or at the very least, prior to the next exam.\nSolutions to exams should be posted immediately after all students have taken the exam.\nGrading of programming and written assignments\nPrograms and written assignments should be graded and returned within two weeks, or less if subsequent assignments depend on them.\nPreparation\nNo assignment should be given without its having been thoroughly reviewed by an instructor or TA.\nAssignments should be of reasonable length, keeping in mind that the student is taking several other courses that require a comparable amount of time. For programming assignments, it is desirable to leave a weekend between assigning the homework and collecting it.\nSimilarly, exams should always be taken by the TA's to determine, at the very least, how long it takes to write the answers.\nCourse Grading\nCourse grading policies should be announced in as much detail as possible at the start of the semester. If grades will be normalized to a curve, then the curve should be published. Since students may use this policy to determine how much effort to expend on different parts of the course, the grading policy should not be altered if it can be avoided. Once the semester is over, no changes in the policy are allowed: University policies on capricious grading require that the announced policy be followed in assigning course grades.\nStudents should be given regular - if possible, continuous - access to information about their position in the class.\nWhen grading classes of mixed undergraduate and graduate students, the instructor should announce up front whether the same grading policy will be used both for graduates and for undergraduates, or a separate scale will be used. The policy should not penalize undergraduates in courses that are expected to be taken by a large number of undergraduates. Two methods that work well are: (1) determine the grading curve based only on the undergrads, and then fit the grads to that scale; (2) determine the grading curve based only on grads, and then fit the undergrads to it.\nIndependent/Individual Study\nCS 397 Individual Study is a course that students can register for to get credit for an individual research project carried on under the guidance of a CS faculty member (or a faculty member from another department approved for supervising a CS 397 section). You may take the course for anywhere from 1 to 3 hours (to be determined by your individual project supervisor) and you may register again for CS 397 Individual Study (under the same or different instructor) in subsequent semesters.\nTo register for CS 397 Individual Study, make sure, first, that a faculty member has agreed to serve as your Individual Study supervisor. Then click on the link below, and fill out the online web form:\nhttps://my.cs.illinois.edu/IndStudy\nThe form will then go to the faculty member you designated as your individual study supervisor. Once they have indicated approval, you will be supplied with a 5-digit CRN which you can enter in Enterprise to register for that faculty member's CS 397 section.\nIf you are a student outside of CS programs, you will need to complete a paper form to add a CS 397 course (available in the CS advising office).\nCS Team Project (CS 497)\nWhile there are many 400-level CS technical electives approved to meet the teaming requirement, this class offers students the opportunity to create a team project with classmates under the guidance of a CS faculty member. You must take this course for 3 credit hours unless it is added onto another CS course (i.e. CS 445). Students will not be approved to register for less than 3 credit hours of this course unless it is attached to another CS course. If CS 497 is added onto another course it should be taken for 1 credit hour.\nTo register for CS 497, you will need to assemble a group of at least 3 undergrads and a Computer Science faculty supervisor for an approved project. Then click on the link below, and fill out the online web form:\nhttps://my.cs.illinois.edu/IndStudy\nWhen completing the form, be sure to include full names for all members of the group and their UINs (if possible). Each group member will need to submit an individual request form. The description should be detailed enough to clarify the team learning goals for the project. Once the instructor has indicated approval, each team member will be supplied with a 5-digit CRN which you can enter in Enterprise to register for that faculty member's CS 497 Team Project section.\nIf you are a student outside of CS programs, you will need to complete a paper form to add a CS 497 course (available in the CS advising office).\nSenior Thesis\nA senior thesis is an individual research project that you formulate, carry out and write up under the guidance of a faculty member.  As the course description states, \"A student works with a faculty member on a mutually agreed upon thesis topic and completes a written thesis. Work involves literature search, oral presentation, analysis and/or implementation, paper preparation, and a written thesis.\"\nA typical senior thesis should be at least 20 to 30 pages long (double-spaced) or about 5000 to 6000 words. Based on feedback from the advisor, a senior thesis is revised multiple times for language, style, and technical content, before it is submitted for a final grade. In addition to submitting the final version of their thesis to their advisor, students must also email it to undergrad@cs.illinois.edu for it to be archived.\nLike CS 397 to register for CS 499 Senior Thesis, make sure, first, that a faculty member has agreed to serve as your thesis supervisor. Then click on the link, below, and fill out the online web form:\nhttps://my.cs.illinois.edu/IndStudy\nThe form will then go to the faculty member you designated as your thesis supervisor. Once they have indicated approval, you will be supplied with a 5-digit CRN which you can enter in Enterprise to register for that faculty member's CS 499 section.\nRegistration restrictions and overrides\nThe CS Office of Undergraduate Programs can help CS students obtain overrides for certain registration restrictions. Examples are as follows:\nOverlapping courses (Time conflict): Enterprise will not let students register for classes with meeting times that overlap. However, the CS Undergraduate Advising Office can provide an override if at least one of the courses is a CS course. To get an override for a CS course (plan to miss a CS course lecture), students must submit a \u2018Time Conflict\u2019 request in the CS petitions portal: https://my.cs.illinois.edu/ugpetitions. The form will be sent to the instructor for the following approvals: 1) the instructor is OK with the student missing class time 2) the instructor is willing to provide a conflict examination if the course overlap results in two final exams scheduled at the same time. Once the instructor approves in the portal, the request will be reviewed by the CS department. Starting for Spring 2023 registration, all time conflict requests for CS courses will need to be submitted in the CS petitions portal. The CS Department will not enter time conflict overrides unless it is a CS course the student plans to miss and a CS instructor who approves the absences (and potential conflict exam). If it is a non-CS course the student plans to miss, the student must seek a time-conflict override from the other course instructor and the department controlling the other course. Students will be notified of decisions within the petition portal (and via automated email). Requests will be reviewed on a rolling basis.  If you are granted the time conflict override, it is your responsibility to understand the expectations and consequences of missing scheduled lectures and keeping up with the missed content.\nPrerequisite restrictions: As part of the Grainger College of Engineering prerequisite enforcement policy, the CS department enforces prerequisites for all CS courses at the 100, 200, and 300-level. Attempts to register for courses without having met prerequisites will yield the following message \u201cCourse Prerequisite and/or Test Score Error \u2013 Contact Course Department\u201d.\nBefore requesting an override, check course explorer to be sure you understand the prerequisites you are missing: https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/DEFAULT/DEFAULT\nIf you have coursework that meets prerequisites for a course but is not on your academic record (such as summer transfer credit) or you have coursework that may be equivalent to listed prerequisites for a course, you can request a prerequisite override from the department: https://my.cs.illinois.edu/ugpetitions. No approvals will be granted without reviewable coursework, for example, no student will be approved to bypass prerequisites for CS courses based on self-study or planned proficiency exams.\nPrerequisite override requests will be reviewed by the Computer Science department within 5 business days. Students will be notified of decisions within the undergraduate petitions portal and via email.\nMajor restrictions: Departments will occasionally restrict registration for certain courses to majors within the department. In most cases, restrictions are described in the university's online course schedule. To find out if and when overrides might be provided or the restrictions lifted, contact the department controlling the course.\nGraduate-level courses (Level restriction): Enterprise will not let undergraduates register for graduate level sections of 400-level courses (4 credit hours). If the course has both a 3- & 4-hour sections, 4-hour sections are generally restricted to graduate-level students.  Any undergraduate wanting the graduate-level 4-hour section or a 500-level course must receive approval from the instructor and department.  To obtain this, students complete the following petition Undergrad Application for Access to CS Grad Sections:   https://my.cs.illinois.edu/ugpetitions/ Requests should be submitted the Thursday before classes begin and anything after will be subject to delays and possibly a late course change (add/drop) form. The requests will be reviewed and overrides given by the Friday before classes begin.  You must complete the petition for any consideration into a grad level course submitted before the add deadline.  If the course has an undergraduate section you must have a seat in the undergrad section until the department reviews the requests.  If the course is filled with graduate students and the course sections appear \"Closed,\" the class is full to capacity and we cannot add more students.  Students in the 5-year BS/MS or BS/MCS program do not need instructor permission to request an override if they encounter a level restriction (email CS Graduate Advising for registration assistance).\nOnline courses: With rare exceptions, CS undergraduates may not register for the online CS courses offered by CS and Engineering Online Programs. The Office of Undergraduate Programs will occasionally provide an override to a graduating senior who has no other way of fulfilling a degree requirement than by taking an online course, but this should normally be avoided.\nProficiency examinations\nThe instructor who is teaching a CS course has the option of offering a proficiency exam. The rule is that students have to get a C- or higher on the exam in order to pass. If students pass the exam, the course will appear on their transcript as a proficiency class (with a PS entered in the grade column - like an AP credit); however, there are no consequences for the student if he/she fails the exam. To request a proficiency exam, contact the current instructor of the course. CS 124, CS 128, CS 173 and CS 225 usually offer proficiency exams some time around the beginning of the spring and fall semesters. For these courses, check the CS proficiency website for more information.\nRetaking classes\nA student can retake any class. Students can only apply for grade replacement, however, under certain circumstances (see Grade Replacement for more information). Except under grade replacement, when a student retakes a class that he/she has already completed, both the old and the new grade are averaged into the student's GPA like any other grades, but the hours are credited only once. For example, a student receiving a D in CS 124 and then retaking the course for a B will have 6 hours of C averaged into his/her GPA but will receive 3 hours of credit toward graduation).\nStudents should retake a class if:\nThey fail a required class\nThey earn a C+ or below in CS 124\nThey earn a C- or below in CS 128\nThey earn a C+ or below in CS 173\nThey earn a C- or below in CS 225\nThey feel they have not sufficiently grasped the material in a course that provides an important foundation for future coursework\nStudy Abroad and Team Requirement (CS in Engineering Only)\nThe team project requirement for the CS in Engineering cannot be completed with a course taken abroad. If a student completes a course equivalent to one of our campus-approved teaming courses, they will be required to complete another approved team project course on campus to meet the CS in Engineering team requirement.\nTransfer credit\nMany UIUC students take courses at other colleges or universities - usually over the summer in order to lighten regular semester schedules. Before taking a course at another institution, current UIUC undergraduates should do the following:\nMake sure that taking a course at another institution will not conflict with your University of Illinois residency requirement. Consult the student code and/or an Admissions and Records Officer (ARO) in your college office.\nCheck to see what credit you'll receive for the course, especially if you want to fulfill a specific requirement. You can check for course equivalency at the University of Illinois by consulting Transferology. You have to set up an account, but it's free.\nIf you cannot find information about University of Illinois equivalency online - if you're taking a course in a state or institution not covered by Transferology or if you're taking a course that hasn't been evaluated yet - you'll have to obtain a syllabus or detailed course description for the course you want transferred and have it evaluated by someone at Illinois. Once you've obtained that information, consult your college office for further instructions. If the course you'd like evaluated is a CS course, you can send the syllabus to undergrad@cs.illinois.edu.\nThe Advanced Composition requirement can be fulfilled with a transfer course but only one that is specifically approved as satisfying the Advanced Composition requirement at UIUC.\nTo have your courses credited here at UIUC, you must request that the institution you attend send a transcript of the courses you took there. Follow the guidelines below for having transcripts sent:\nNon-graduating seniors in the CS/Engineering program and all students in the CS programs in the College of LAS, or College of FAA, or College of ACES should send transcripts to:\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nOffice of Admissions and Records\n901 West Illinois Street\nUrbana, IL 61801-3028\n217-333-0302\nGraduating seniors in the CS/Engineering program should also send transcripts to:\nRobert Porter | Jamie Hannah\nCollege of Engineering\n206 Engineering Hall\n1308 W. Green Street\nUrbana, IL 61801\nRequirements\nCourse substitutions for requirements\nStudents who transfer into CS from another program on the Urbana campus can often substitute courses that they have taken for their previous program of study for CS requirements if the courses are roughly equivalent. Below is a list of courses that are commonly substituted:\nMATH 213: Students who transfer into a CS program with MATH 213 credit or who come in as freshmen with MATH 213 transfer credit may substitute that credit for CS 173.  We strongly advise them, however, that they should take the proficiency exam for CS 173 to ensure that they have a thorough grasp of the material for future coursework, and to take CS 173 if they do not pass the proficiency exam for it. The reason is that CS 173 is better preparation for CS 225, and more so for CS 374.\nStudents who enter the department without CS 173 or MATH 213 *must* take CS 173 because (again) it is stronger preparation for follow-on courses, particularly CS 225 and CS 374 (and CS 421 for that matter).\nECE 120-220: may substitute for CS 124 and 128 for students who have already taken the ECE courses and transferred into CS or for students pursuing a CS Minor.\nCS 450 for CS 357: CS-Engineering students may substitute CS 450 for CS 357, but if they do so, they may not use CS 450 to count as one of their 400-level CS electives. They must also notify CS undergraduate advisors (undergrad@cs.illinois.edu) that they intend to make this substitution.  This policy applies to Stats & CS majors, as well.  Math & CS majors may take CS 450 without first taking CS 357, in which case they must take an extra 400-level CS or Math elective, not otherwise counting for a major requirement, to substitute for CS 357.\nMATH 225: Students who came in as freshmen with MATH 225 transfer credit or who took MATH 225 before transferring from another department or institution into CS/Engineering may substitute that credit for MATH 257/MATH 415.  This is only for students in CS/Engineering, not Math & CS or Stat & CS (all the other CS + X programs specifically include MATH 225 as an option).  We strongly advise them, however, that they should either take or pass a proficiency exam for MATH 257/MATH 415 or take MATH 416 because these courses prepares them better for courses like CS 357 and many 400-level CS electives (particularly in areas like Machine Learning, AI and Scientific Computing).\nMATH 416 may substitute for MATH 225, MATH 257 or MATH 415 for any CS program. Students who want to take MATH 416 must obtain permission from the Math Department - mathadvising@illinois.edu, 313 Altgeld Hall.\nDegree audit (DARS report)\nA degree audit or DARS report is a summary of your degree requirements and coursework. The Office of the Registrar's website has information on student access to the DARS system. You can also obtain a printout of your degree audit from the CS Academic Office or from your college office.\nIf you find anything in your degree audit report that does not appear accurate, send an email to your assigned CS advisor or undergrad@cs.illinois.edu.\nMinimum GPA requirements\nCollege of Engineering\nFor graduation, the technical and the overall grade point averages must be at least 2.0. The department also requires that the technical grade point average be above 2.25 for the first thirty hours of technical course to continue as a computer science major. (The technical grade point average includes all computer science and required mathematics courses or substitutes. It does not include physics courses or science electives.) To achieve honors at graduation, a specific grade point average must be met. Please see Honors for more details.\nCollege of Liberal Arts and Sciences\nFor graduation, the major and the overall grade point averages must be at least 2.0. (The major grade point average is similar to the technical grade point average above. It is the grade point average for all computer science and mathematics courses.) Other technical courses such as physics are not counted. To achieve honors at graduation, a specific grade point average must be met. Please see Honors for more details.\nProbation\nFor policies and procedures related to academic probation, see Rules 79 and 80 of the university Code of Policies and Regulations Applying to All Students and the policy and procedures website for your college, Engineering or LAS.\nMiscellaneous\nPolicy on Cheating\nSee the Computer Science Department Honor Code.\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT)\nPLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY AND CAREFULLY!\nInternational students on an F-1 visa who wish to complete a paid internship must apply for a Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and receive a CPT letter from their departmental advisor. Students should submit a CPT request through the I-Start portal on the ISSS website after obtaining ENG 310 approval.\nNote that the US federal government *requires* that students on an F-1 visa must be enrolled in a course or curriculum which explicitly requires an internship in order to be employed in the US. This cannot be avoided and you will have to pay some tuition.\nPlan to register for ENG 310 during the term in which you are doing your internship. For more information about the current College of Engineering CPT request process, please review the College of Engineering ENG 310 page. Students with CPT questions may email egon@illinois.edu directly for clarification. CS students are not required to meet with a CS advisor before requesting ENG 310 approval. \nHonor Code\nSee the CS Department Honor Code.\nHonors in CS Majors\nSee Honors.\nMinimum and maximum number of hours\nAll undergraduates (except students in their last semester before graduation) must maintain a schedule of at least 12 hours credit (the minimum required to be a full-time student) during the fall and spring semesters. To go below 12 hours, students must obtain permission from their college office and this is granted only under exceptional circumstances. Students in their last semester before graduation may take fewer than 12 hours of courses, but they should check to make sure that they are meeting all requirements to graduate. Some sources of financial aid, student loans and student insurance require full-time student status, so students should never go below 12 hours without contacting their funding and insurance sources! Students taking courses during the summer terms have no minimum-hours requirement.\nStudents may register for a maximum of 18 hours without permission during a fall or spring semester. For the Summer II term, the maximum is 9 hours, for Summer I, the maximum is 4 hours. Students can obtain permission to register for more hours but they must receive a dean's permission from their college office to do so.\nMinors\nCS students are free to take any minors allowed by the offering department. It is the offering department that decides who is eligible for their minor. (Note: the math minor is open to CS in Engineering students, even though it only requires one or two courses beyond what is already required.)\nFor more information about \"declaring\" a minor please see the Provost's resource page, including links to necessary forms.\nTuition and Fees\nIf you have any questions about tuition and fees you can find answers by consulting the Registrar's Office tuition and fees webpage.\nWorking - for credit or for pay\nDomestic students (US citizenship or permanent resident status) may work part-time during the semester as long as the work does not impede academic progress. International students must apply for a CPT (Curricular Practical Training) in order to work (with some exceptions) \u2013 consult ISSS for more information. A student doing a CPT registers for ENG 310, and is required to satisfy additional learning requirements as part of the course, which go beyond their internship work.\nMany students ask whether they can get some type of independent study credit for work (paid, or unpaid) that they are already doing (e.g., as an intern) for some organization. The short answer is \"no\". While it is no doubt often the case that working in some capacity is also a learning experience, unless there are clear learning goals articulated by a faculty member that happen to include and go beyond the work done, and unless that faculty member is willing to oversee the work as an independent study project approved by the Director of Undergraduate Programs, no credit can be given.\nFor additional information, contact the appropriate advising office:\nCS Office of Undergraduate Programs\nVisit: 1210 Siebel Center\nCall: 217-333-4428\nEmail: undergrad@cs.illinois.edu Grainger Engineering Undergraduate Programs Office\nVisit: 206 Engineering Hall\nCall: 217-333-2280\nEmail: engineering@illinois.edu LAS Student Academic Affairs\nVisit: 2002 Lincoln Hall\nCall: 217-333-1705\nEmail: las-studentoffice@illinois.edu\nFAA Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs\nVisit: 110 Architecture Building\nCall: 217-333-6061\nEmail: faa-uaa@illinois.edu\nCollege of Media Student Services Center (SSC)\nVisit: 18 Gregory Hall\nCall: 217-244-4329\nEmail: media-ssc@illinois.edu\nCollege of ACES Academic Programs Office\nVisit: 128 Mumford Hall\nCall: 217-333-3380\nEmail: aces-academics@illinois.edu"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-student-opportunity-series-cs-sos", "data": "HomeAcademicsUndergraduate AcademicsCS Student Opportunity Series ...\nCS Student Opportunity Series (CS SOS)\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nDegree & Program Options\nRegistration\nPolicies and Procedures\nUndergraduate Advising\nCS Student Opportunity Series (CS SOS)\nUndergraduate Forms\nHonors\nTransfer Students\nGraduate Academics\nCourses\nHonor Code\nStudent Resources\nWelcome to the CS Student Opportunity Series!\nThe CS Student Opportunity Series (SOS) provides tools and resources for undergraduate students in CS majors to grow academically, professionally, and personally.

Awards and scholarships are presented each year during the department's Spring Awards Banquet. The James Scholar program is open to qualified students within the College of Engineering and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Each of the colleges recognizes its top graduates during graduation ceremonies.\nCollege of Engineering Honors\nJames Scholar Program in Engineering\nThe gifted undergraduate student who is seeking the challenge of advanced and unusual academic opportunities and the maximum freedom in course selection will find such opportunity in the James Scholar Program in Engineering. In addition to the various honors sections, courses, and special educational opportunities made available by the various departments of the college, the program administers several engineering honors courses. These courses are designed to bring together James Scholars from throughout the college to study various interdisciplinary subjects.\nThe James Scholar Program is voluntary and therefore enrolls superior students who are actively seeking unusual academic challenges. It strives to interact with each student on an individual basis; its foundation lies in the student's interest and academic goals.\nThe College of Engineering requires its James Scholars to devise an \"honors contract\" in consultation with the honors advisor. For CS, honors advising, like other academic advising, is handled in the Academic Office. Contact undergrad@cs.illinois.edu for honors advising. For more information about the James Scholar Program in Engineering, including eligibility criteria, see the website.\nGraduating with Honors in Engineering\nHonors awarded at graduation to superior students are designated on the diploma as Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors.\nEligibility\nHonors Students with a cumulative University of Illinois grade point average of at least 3.5.\nHigh Honors Students with a cumulative University of Illinois grade point average of 3.8.\nHighest Honors may be awarded to any student upon recommendation of the department. The criteria used in selecting individuals for Highest Honors recognition include a GPA of at least 3.95 or a combination of a GPA of at least 3.8 plus one or more of the following: 1) evidence of a broad range of supplementary activities of an academic and/or professional nature, 2) a substantial body of advanced CS coursework beyond that required for the degree (individual study, graduate-level work, senior thesis), 3) a substantial body of advanced coursework outside of CS, e.g. a second major or a minor that does not overlap significantly with degree requirements (e.g. not the Math minor).\nCollege of Liberal Arts and Sciences Honors\nJames Scholar Program in LAS\nWithin the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS), the James Scholar Honors Program encourages academically gifted students to fully develop their intellectual abilities and achieve the college's highest academic recognition. Scholars are charged with the responsibility of seeking sustained intellectual achievement as undergraduates by achieving and annually maintaining James Scholar certification.\nOnly the top 15 percent of the entering freshman are invited to participate in the LAS's James Scholar Honors Program. These incoming students are notified of their admission with a letter from the dean of the college. Continuing or transfer students with a 3.5 (A=4.0) cumulative grade point average may nominate themselves as James Scholars.\nJames Scholars must meet the requirements each academic year to remain in good standing to continue receiving the program's benefits. To be certified as a James Scholar in LAS each year, scholars must fulfill the following criteria: complete at least two honors courses (one per semester) or Honors Credit Agreements during the academic year and earn a 3.5 cumulative grade point average.\nGraduating with Distinction in LAS\nCriteria for graduation with Distinction, High Destinction and Highest Destinction in the LAS CS programs can be found under the degree requirements listing for each major in the university's Academic Catalog, as follows:\nMathematics & Computer Science\nStatistics & Computer Science\nPrograms not listed above have yet to establish criteria."}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program", "data": "HomeAcademicsGraduate AcademicsPhD Program\nPhD Program\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nGraduate Academics\nPhD Program\nFinal Exam (Thesis Defense)\nGuidelines for Forming Ph.D. Committee\nPh.D. / M.S.

It also serves to disseminate the work to the public (including faculty, students, colleagues, friends, and family). In many ways it represents a celebration of the completion of the work. Unlike the Preliminary Exam, which is closed, the Final Exam is open to the public and announced along with other public seminars.\nExam Policies\nThe Thesis Defense must be taken at least four months after passing the Preliminary Exam. It is recommended that there be at least a 12 month gap between the Preliminary Exam and the Final Exam.\nThe Student, \"Chair\" and at least one additional voting member must be physically present for the exam. If the student designates a Chair and Co-Chair, both must be physically present at the exam. If the student knows that their Chair person may not physically be at the exam, they can designate another Chair person prior to scheduling the exam. Please keep in mind that that person will no longer hold the title as \"Chair\" person on all forms. The remaining committee may participate in the exam via teleconference or other electronic communication media. The Ph.D. committee guidelines in the Ph.D. Committees section must be followed. The committee for the Final Exam does not have to be the same as for the Preliminary Exam, although it often is. Any changes due to circumstances that may occur must meet all Department and Graduate College requirements.\nA full thesis draft must be submitted to the Ph.D. committee at least three weeks prior to the scheduled defense to allow committee members a reasonable amount of time to review the thesis.\nThe proposed committee and exam date must be submitted to the Graduate College at least 3 weeks prior to the exam through the Graduate College Student Portal.  (Note: The process to submit the .Ph.D Preliminary and Final Examination committee requests has been revised effective Spring 2022.) The Graduate College requires this time to approve the committee and officially appoint it.  Upon approval of the committee, CS Academic Advisers will communicate with the Exam Committee Chair to ensure the necessary documentation is sent to the Committee Chair, to receive the Final Examination results from the Committee, and to report the final results to the Graduate College.\nThe student's presentation is publicly advertised so that all who are interested in the research may attend.\nAfter the presentation and questions are concluded, the public is asked to leave to so that the committee can privately pass judgment on the work.\nAll students must be registered for the term in which the Final Examination occurs. Students who have completed all required coursework and the credit hours can register for zero hours of CS599 if there do not hold a graduate assistantship for the term.  Students who are on a graduate assistantship must register for nine credit hours in Fall and Spring terms. Please keep in mind that all of the fees including McKinley, transportation, campus rec facilities, clean air technology and Krannert will not be automatically assessed if a student registers below six hours for Spring or Fall terms. Student health insurance fees will be assessed. Students who require the additional services will need to pay for them separately when registering for less than six hours in Spring or Fall and less than three hours for Summer term.\nThe defense itself usually proceeds as follows:\na few minutes of private discussion by the committee;\na public presentation presented by the Ph.D. candidate, typically lasting for 45 minutes;\nquestions from the committee, in front of the public;\nquestions from the public;\nquestions from the committee without the public present;\nprivate discussion by the committee; and\noutcome decided and announced to the candidate.\nContact Jennifer Comstock (or at 333-3527) in the Academic Office with any questions.\nGuidance on How to Prepare\nYou should not rush to schedule a Final Exam if the work is not completely finished or the thesis is not completely written.\nIt is common for the committee to suggest some minor improvements or corrections to the manuscript; however, it is usually not the case that substantial new work is expected. If there is any risk of the committee requesting further work, be prepared to allot the time necessary to make the recommended changes or enhancements to the thesis. Consult your advisor on this point.\nIt is important to attend other defenses to understand the whole Ph.D. process and to learn valuable skills from other students' defenses.\n  Graduate Advising\nA Guiding Hand for Grads - Our Academic Office is available to assist Illinois CS graduate students every weekday.\nAdvising Contacts"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/guidelines-forming-phd-committee", "data": "HomeAcademicsGraduate AcademicsPhD ProgramGuidelines for Forming Ph.D. C...\nGuidelines for Forming Ph.D. Committee\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nGraduate Academics\nPhD Program\nFinal Exam (Thesis Defense)\nGuidelines for Forming Ph.D. Committee\nPh.D. / M.S.

The committee shares the responsibility of guiding the student's research to successful completion. Students should not view the committee as obstacles, but rather as additional mentors and possible promoters of their thesis research. When applying for jobs, committee members are often the first choice for seeking recommendation letters. It is expected that the Ph.D. advisor work closely with the student in determining the most appropriate committee members.\nTimeframe for Establishing Committees\nIn the semester that the qualifying exam is passed, the student is expected to form a Ph.D. committee. Committee members may easily be added or removed during the time from the qualifying exam to the final exam (thesis defense).\nCommittee Members\nThe Ph.D. committee must satisfy the requirements imposed by the Graduate College and the Department of Computer Science:\nThere must be at least four voting members (normally, all are designated as such).\nAt least three and no less than half of the voting members must be members of the Illinois Graduate Faculty.\nAt least two of the voting members must be tenured faculty from the University of Illinois.\nAt least three members must be members of the extended faculty in the Department of Computer Science (DCS) at Illinois with graduate advising privileges in the DCS. Members who satisfy this criteria include the regular faculty, the teaching faculty with graduate advising privileges in the DCS, and people with non-visiting (assistant/associate/full) professor appointments in the DCS that carry one or more of the following modifiers - adjunct, affiliate, research or emeritus). Two of these three members must be full-time (non-affiliate) members in the DCS.\nAt least one member must be from outside of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (outside member is required only for students who have passed the qualifying exam in spring 2006 or later, however, it is highly recommended for all students). The outside member cannot have been a student of the current thesis advisor or any other University of Illinois committee member nor have been a University of Illinois student within the last five years. The outside committee member must have independent publications that occurred after earning their Ph.D. In addition, if the outside member is a Post-doc, he/she can serve as a non-voting member only.\nIf there are more than 4 members on a committee, the majority vote needs to favor the CS Department faculty. If you are unsure, please contact Jennifer Comstock at jcom@illinois.edu.\nNote: The outside member must have a Ph.D. and does not need to be a university faculty member. For example, this member could belong to an industrial or government research lab. If necessary, teleconferencing technology may be used for the prelim exam. For approval of the outside member, the Department of Computer Science and the Graduate College require their CV and a brief statement of why they were chosen.\nThe five requirements above are also imposed on the Ph.D. committee for the Final Exam (although the committees may be different).\nAdvice on How to Form the Committee\nIt is good for students to involve additional researchers in their efforts as early as possible. Remember, students are not locked into particular committee choices until their Preliminary Exam. In some sense, the Ph.D. committee is just a formal mechanism to stimulate interaction between faculty and students.\nIt is generally recommended that a student have at least one committee member who is not a specialist in the general area of research pursued in the thesis. The ability to explain and justify research to outsiders is crucial to the success of a researcher.\nIt is fairly common to have more committee members than the minimum of four. This helps to further enhance the quality and visibility of the work. Furthermore, it may be easier to satisfy the five requirements on Ph.D. committees by having more members.\n  Graduate Advising\nA Guiding Hand for Grads - Our Academic Office is available to assist Illinois CS graduate students every weekday.\nAdvising Contacts"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/preliminary-exam", "data": "HomeAcademicsGraduate AcademicsPhD ProgramPreliminary Exam\nPreliminary Exam\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nGraduate Academics\nPhD Program\nFinal Exam (Thesis Defense)\nGuidelines for Forming Ph.D. Committee\nPh.D. / M.S.

In addition, students should have a Prelim committee in place prior to writing their proposal and scheduling the prelim exam. To learn more about the guidelines and process of forming a Ph.D. committee, visit the Ph.D. Committee section.\nPurpose\nWriting a good proposal is an important part of being a successful researcher. The Thesis Proposal (Preliminary Exam) is viewed as an important milestone that helps students develop this skill. The Ph.D. student writes a proposal that is submitted to the Ph.D. committee prior to the exam. The Thesis Proposal presentation gives the Ph.D. committee a formal opportunity to evaluate the research progress and goals of the student. Thus, the two main purposes of the Preliminary Exam are to develop proposal writing skills and to obtain feedback on the research plan from the Ph.D. committee.\nExam Policies\nThe Thesis Proposal presentation (Preliminary Exam) should be held within a year or two of passing the Qualifying Exam. It may be taken no later than five semesters after passing the Qualifying Exam. All students must be registered for the term in which the Prelim Exam occurs.\nAll Ph.D. candidates whose native language is not English, regardless of US citizenship, must pass the TOEFL iBT-speaking subsection(passing scores is 24), the IELTS-speaking subsection(passing score is 8), or the EPI Exam (passing score is 5) administered by the university, prior to attempting the Preliminary Exam. For students who have entered the program fall 2011 and foward must complete this requirement before attempting the Qualifying Exam.\nThe Thesis Proposal must be submitted to the Ph.D. committee at least three weeks prior to the exam. This gives the committee sufficient time to carefully read the proposal and evaluate the ideas. Failure to submit the proposal on time may result in having to reschedule the exam.\nThe Ph.D. committee for the exam must satisfy the five criteria given in the Ph.D. Committee section.\nThe proposed committee and exam date must be submitted to the Graduate College at least 3 weeks prior to the exam through the Graduate College Student Portal.  (Note: The process to submit the .Ph.D Preliminary and Final Examination committee requests has been revised effective Spring 2022.) The Graduate College requires this time to approve the committee and officially appoint it.  Upon approval of the committee, CS Academic Advisers will communicate with the Exam Committee Chair to ensure the necessary documentation is sent to the Committee Chair, to receive the Preliminary Examination results from the Committee, and to report the final results to the Graduate College.\nAdditional requirements for the committee and the format of the exam must also satisfy the exam policies defined by the Graduate College. \nContact Jennifer Comstock (or at 333-4730) in the Academic Office with any questions.\nGuidance on How to Write the Proposal\nA balance must be struck between satisfying severe space limitations and providing the most critical details. The proposal is not a binding agreement between the student and the Ph.D. committee on the precise tasks that must be accomplished. Through frequent interactions with Ph.D. committee members, the student can adapt the specific thesis accomplishments as necessary.\nThe Thesis Proposal should be between 15 and 25 pages (when single-spaced format). Bibliographic references are not included in this page count (having more references is encouraged). There are no explicit page limits or formatting requirements. If proposals are much shorter or longer than the norm, the Ph.D. committee will question the reasons for this. If the proposal is much too long, the committee may recommend rescheduling the exam after the proposal is rewritten.\nThree main criteria are usually applied in evaluating a proposal (the first two are similar to the National Science Foundation's guidelines for evaluating research proposals).\nIntellectual merit: What is the importance of the activity to advancing knowledge or understanding?\nExpected impact: What impact can be expected in terms of particular research communities and on society in general?\nFeasibility: How likely are the stated goals to be achieved by the candidate?\nBased on these criteria, the Thesis Proposal should contain:\nAn overview of the state of the art, which helps to show that the candidate has a good grasp of the relevant research fields.\nA brief summary of research results obtained so far by the candidate. This includes citing prior publications and current submissions produced by the student.\nA clear description of the remaining problems and goals.\nSome details of the proposed technical approach.\nClear arguments as to why the work is interesting in terms of intellectual merit and expected impact.\nAn explanation of how the goals can be accomplished within the expected amount of time.\nThe Thesis Proposal should not be\nA preliminary draft of the thesis.\nParticular chapters or parts of the thesis.\nA survey of the candidate's research field.\nAn existing publication or technical report.\n  Graduate Advising\nA Guiding Hand for Grads - Our Academic Office is available to assist Illinois CS graduate students every weekday.\nAdvising Contacts"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/qualifying-exam", "data": "HomeAcademicsGraduate AcademicsPhD ProgramQualifying Exam\nQualifying Exam\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nGraduate Academics\nPhD Program\nFinal Exam (Thesis Defense)\nGuidelines for Forming Ph.D. Committee\nPh.D. / M.S.

Faculty evaluate whether the student has the knowledge, experience, perspective, and determination to complete the Ph.D. program. In addition, faculty will evaluate the student's presentation and communication skills to ensure a mastery of English sufficient to teach in a U.S. institution can be achieved by the end of the Program. Researchers in various areas may assess these qualities differently; therefore, the format and content of the exam vary dramatically depending on the research area.\nDeadline\nStudents must attempt the Qualifying Exam no later than the fourth semester. Students must have completed all the core coursework requirements (i.e. the Required Courses identified on the Program of Study form) and must have a Ph.D. advisor by the time of the Qualifying Exam. An advisor agreement form must be on file with the Academic Office. In addition, students whose native language is not English, regardless of citizenship, must pass the EPI (passing score is 5+), the TOEFL iBT-speaking subsection (passing score is 24+), or the IELTS-speaking subsection (passing score is 8+) prior to attempting the Qualifying Exam. It is highly recommended that students complete this requirement within their first year of the Ph.D. program to avoid any surprises at the time of the Qualifying Exam.\nQualifying Exams are held during a four-week period, starting on the Monday closest to the third week of each fall and spring semester. For any questions regarding the Qualifying Exam process, please email Jennifer Comstock or call her at 333-4730.\nQualifying Exam Statements\nIn the semester prior to the Qualifying Exam, students will be asked to submit a \"Qual Statement\" (MS Word or PDF (must save first, then edit) version). This outline of research interests is forwarded to the appropriate research area committee. The area committee appoints three faculty members whose research matches the stated interests as the examining committee. However, in general, the committee will not include the thesis advisor. In many cases, this committee will select research papers to be studied by the candidate for the exam. After the Qualifying Exam Committees are announced, students are responsible for contacting their committee to schedule the exam, secure space for the exam, confirm the time and location to all committee members, and prepare necessary materials for the exam. Students must also inform Jennifer Comstockof their exam schedule and location. The results of the qualifying exam may be pass, fail, or conditional pass (conditions are usually requirements to take a course or two). Students with a \"pass\" result will be eligible to register for CS 599 thesis hours, effective their next term of registration. Qual results are reported to the Academic Office on an area-by-area basis, so it may take a week or more for a student to learn the results.\nFailed Qualifying Exam\nA student who fails the Qualifying Exam may, at the discretion of the examining committee, be allowed one more attempt to pass it in the semester immediately following the first attempt. If the Qualifying Exam is not passed, the student may request to switch to the M.S. program, assuming it can be completed expediently and no previous M.S. was completed elsewhere in Computer Science (Graduate College does not confer duplicate M.S. degrees). All other requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Graduate Study Committee.\nQualifying Exam Committee Policy\nThe PhD. Qualifying exam committee should be composed of:\nCS faculty and CS affiliate faculty only; and\nat least two CS tenure-track faculty.\nA second attempt at the qual exam shall have at least one member from the previous Qual committee who must be a CS faculty.\nExceptions to Qual committee formation may be requested in exceptional cases by contacting the Academic Office for approval.\nQualifying Exam Research Area Guidelines\nArchitecture, Compilers, and Parallel Computing\nArtificial Intelligence\nBioinformatics and Computational Biology\nComputers and Education\nData and Information Systems\nInteractive Computing\nProgramming Languages, Formal Methods, and Software Engineering\nScientific Computing\nSecurity and Privacy\nSystems and Networking\nTheory and Algorithms\nGuidance on How to Prepare\nThe format and content of the Qualifying Exam varies dramatically depending on the area. For most areas, review the guidelines above. To prepare for the Qualifying Exam, it is highly recommended that students talk with\ntheir advisor,\nfaculty in the area, and\nstudents who have taken the particular exam before.\nThis information is particularly helpful for a student who has research interests that span multiple areas. Occasionally, more than one exam might be appropriate. The student should consult with his/her thesis advisor as to which exam is best for the planned research.\n  Graduate Advising\nA Guiding Hand for Grads - Our Academic Office is available to assist Illinois CS graduate students every weekday.\nAdvising Contacts"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/phd-program-study-process", "data": "HomeAcademicsGraduate AcademicsPhD ProgramPhD Program of Study Process\nPhD Program of Study Process\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nGraduate Academics\nPhD Program\nFinal Exam (Thesis Defense)\nGuidelines for Forming Ph.D. Committee\nPh.D. / M.S.

Two committee members are appointed from the student's primary area of research interest and the third member from the secondary area of research interest.  Effective Fall 2020, the student's (prospective) advisor can serve as a committee member.\nStudents must prepare the Program of Study form in consultation with their Program of Study committee through individual meetings, a group meeting, or other forms of correspondence. Students will discuss their area of interests with their committee to determine what required courses must be completed and develop strategies for meeting educational and career goals as well as the Ph.D. graduation requirements.\nRequired Coursework: A minimum of one course and a maximum of three courses (not including CS 591 PHD and CS 591 TA seminars) must be identified as required courses. Required courses are courses you and your committee agree that you must complete. Each of these courses should be marked as pre-qual or pre-prelim.\nPre-qual courses must be completed prior to taking your qualifying exam. Some exceptions can be made for any courses you take in the same semester as your qual. Pre-prelim courses must be completed before you can schedule your preliminary examination.\nAny changes to your required courses must be approved by all members of your Program of Study Committee and a revised form must be completed. \nRecommended Coursework:  Courses that your committee suggests and you plan to take that are intended to help you plan your studies during your research. These courses are not required and any changes to recommended courses do not require an update to your program of study form. These courses will meet the minimum credit hours required for your degree.\nStrategy: brief explanation of the motivation for the choice of coursework.\nHere is a \"Sample\" of a program of study form to view. Students must have all three committee members electronically approve the completed Program of Study form by the posted deadline announced when committee assignments are released. The Program of Study form may be altered by the student at any time, but a revised copy must be completed and approved by the Program of Study committee if any of the \"Required Coursework\" is changed.\nRequests for a change of a Program of Study committee member may be submitted to Viveka P. Kudaligama (kudaliga@illinois.edu) for consideration.\nNote: Students' progress with respect to their Program of Study and the quality of the Program of Study itself are open to evaluation at the annual area meetings, where all Ph.D. students are evaluated. For a student who is not making satisfactory progress in terms of Qualifying Examination preparation, depth of coursework, breadth of coursework, and so on, will receive a warning indicating the requirements to be completed.\nHow to access the Program of Study Form\nThe Program of Study Form is an online form available through My.CS portal in the \"Grad Student Toolbox\" area. Students can \"Save\" the form and return to complete the form over multiple sessions. Once all data is entered, students must click \"Submit for Committee Review\" at the bottom of the form, which closes the form.   Prior to submitting the form for committee review, students must also confirm with their committee members that each individual committee member will approve the submitted course list.  Please keep in mind this may take several iterations for all committee members to approve the proposed plan, and plan for time accordingly. Once submitted, the form will be routed to the committee members for electronic approval. All committee approvals must be logged in My.CS system by the posted deadline.  (First-year PhD students in the CS 591 PHD/PH2 seminar may have an earlier deadline to have the approval process completed.)\nNote: If the Program of Study Form is not available in the \"Grad Student Toolbox\" area,  please use the drop-down menu \"Add content to above column\" to add Program of Study Form. If Grad Student Toolbox is not visible, the same menu can be used to add it to the main account page. \nA few things to remember when completing this online form.\nWhen entering in a CS 598 and CS 591course, it is important that you start the course name off with the section number - RHC Special Topics or PHD Advanced Seminar. We need to know what section you plan to complete when entering in a 598 or 591. This also goes for any 498 courses as well.\nTwo courses can be entered for one required course. Students should use this if the committee says that either course would be acceptable. To do this, enter in the first course and click \"Add\". Then under \"Action\" next to the course that was just added, click on the \"OR\". This will allow you to add the other course. This means that you must complete one of these two courses in order to meet that required course requirement.\nWhen entering in \"Strategy\", \"General Comments\", or any other comments in the text boxes, avoid using apostrophe.\nAny problems with accessing or completing the online Program of Study form, please contact either Viveka P. Kudaligama (kudaliga@illinois.edu) or Engineering Tech Support (engrit-apps@illinois.edu).\nAdditional Recommendations and Information to Consider\nPh.D. Coursework Requirements\nCS Current Course Schedule and Class Websites\nAll CS Graduate Level Courses (Graduate level courses are 400- and 500-level)\n  Graduate Advising\nA Guiding Hand for Grads - Our Academic Office is available to assist Illinois CS graduate students every weekday.\nAdvising Contacts"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/phd-ms-thesis-format-review-guidelines", "data": "HomeAcademicsGraduate AcademicsPhD ProgramPh.D. / M.S.

Busy professionals can complete a degree online while they continue to meet their current life and career obligations. Illinois Computer Science has partnered with Coursera to use its massive open online course (MOOC) platform to offer the MCS to students in a more flexible and affordable way than is possible on campus. Students can earn the Online MCS in as little as one year, or in as many as five years.\nThe Online MCS program is a non-thesis (coursework-only) degree that requires 32 credit hours of graduate coursework, completed through eight graduate-level courses each at the four credit hour level. The MCS requires that four of these eight courses are chosen from unique \"core\" areas of computer science, and that three of these eight courses must be at the advanced graduate level (500-level). The Online MCS currently offers coursework in the core areas of artificial intelligence, databases, human-computer interaction, software engineering, scientific computing and high-performance computing.\nStudents receive lectures through Coursera's massive open online course (MOOC) platform, but are advised and assessed by Illinois faculty and teaching assistants on the more rigorous set of assignments, projects, and exams required for university degree credit.\n  Students specifically interested in a data science focus should consider the University of Illinois Master of Computer Science in Data Science (MCS-DS) Track.\nApplication Information\nWho may apply?  Applicants should hold a 4-year bachelor's degree (or equivalent). Students with a bachelor\u2019s degree in a field other than CS are encouraged to apply, but they must have prerequisite coursework or commensurate experience in object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, linear algebra, and statistics/probability. Applicants without this can strengthen their application for admission by passing the optional Data Structures Proficiency Exam. The recommended undergraduate GPA for applicants applying to the Professional Master's program is a 3.2/4.0 or higher. The Department of Computer Science does not require GRE scores for any of its graduate programs. Applications for the MCS do not require letters of recommendation, but they will be considered if included, especially if used to justify experience in lieu of required coursework, or other irregularities.\nApplication Deadlines\nApplication Process & Requirements\nCheck Status of Application Materials\nAdmission for UIUC Graduates\nIf you completed any CS or CS+X major or a CS minor at Illinois with a GPA of 3.0 or better in the last two years of your undergraduate degree and a GPA of 3.2 or better in CS courses, you are guaranteed admission to our Online MCS or MCS in Data Science (MCS-DS) programs. \nOnline MCS Admissions Overview\nPlay/Pause\n  Online MCS Degree Requirements\nPrintable version.\nNote: Each Online MCS course is four credit hours.\nBreadth Requirements\nMust complete four courses (16 credit hours) each from a different area, from the following core areas with a grade of B- or higher.\nArtificial Intelligence:\nCS 441 Applied Machine Learning \nCS 445 Computational Photography \nCS 447 Natural Language Processing \nCS 598 Deep Learning for Healthcare\nDatabase and Information Systems: CS 410 Text Information Systems \nCS 411 Database Systems \nCS 412 Introduction to Data Mining \nGraphics/HCI:\nCS 418 Interactive Computer Graphics  \nCS 445 Computational Photography\nCS 416 Data Visualization \nCS 519 Scientific Visualization\nParallel Computing: CS 484 Parallel Programming\nProgramming Languages & Software Engineering: CS 421 Programming Languages and Compilers \nCS 427 Software Engineering I \nScientific Computing:\nCS 450 Numerical Analysis \nSecurity and Privacy: CS 463 Computer Security II\nSystems and Networking: \nCS 425 Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts) \nCS 435 Cloud Networking\nCS 437 Internet of Things\nCS 498 Cloud Computing Applications\nAdvanced Coursework\nMust complete three courses (12 credit hours).\nCS 513 Theory and Practice of Data Cleaning \nCS 519 Scientific Visualization\nCS 598 Foundations of Data Curation \nCS 598 Practical Statistical Learning* \nCS 598 Advanced Bayesian Modeling \nCS 598 Deep Learning for Healthcare\nCS 598 Cloud Computing Capstone* \nCS 598 Data Mining Capstone* \n* Prerequisites apply.

Component: 120 hours plus 3 \"Breadth Requirement\" courses for 9-12 graduate hours\nThe same required courses as the traditional B.S. degree, with the minimum hours required reduced to 120 hours.\nMust complete 3 \"Breadth Requirement\" courses: three different courses, each from a different area, from the following eight core areas with a grade of B- or higher.\nUniversity undergraduate student minimum residence requirement satisfied.\nOverall GPA of 3.0 or higher maintained through the completion of the B.S. component of the program.\nM.S. Component: Minimum 16-19 additional coursework hours plus 4 hours of CS 599 thesis\nThe program is identical to the traditional M.S. program, with the \"Breadth Requirement\" satisfied while still classified as an undergraduate.\nStudents who take the \"Breadth Requirement\" courses for 3 credit hours instead of 4 credit hours will need to complete a minimum of 19 additional coursework hours.\nAdditional Coursework: Graduate (400- and 500-level) coursework from Computer Science, other Grainger College of Engineering Departments, MATH, STAT, or PHYS are pre-approved as Additional Coursework. All other courses must receive prior approval from the CS Graduate Advising Office in order to satisfy degree requirements.\nStudents must satisfy the university's graduate student minimum residence requirement.\nStudents must complete the remaining M.S. degree requirements in one academic year (fall-spring-summer or spring-summer-fall).\nStudents must maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 through the completion of the M.S. component of the program.\nUniversity Residency Requirements\nUndergraduate residency requirements include a student spending the first three years, earning not less than 90 semester hours, or the last year (two semesters or the equivalent), earning not fewer than 30 hours, in residence at the Urbana-Champaign campus, uninterrupted by any work in another institution. Graduate residency requirements include that half or more of the graduate hours applied toward the degree must be earned in courses counted for residence credit. Consult the University of Illinois Programs of Study book for additional details about university residency requirements.\nAdditional Information\nStudents may earn graduate hours for the M.S. component \"Breadth Requirement\" taken during the third and fourth year while a classified undergraduate. Students are required to perform and be graded at the (more advanced) graduate student level in those courses or must register in the graduate level section of a course when offered.\nStudents who do not complete all 5-Year B.S.- M.S. degree program requirements may request by petition to have graduate hours earned, including the Breadth Requirement coursework, converted to undergraduate hours and applied toward a traditional B.S. in Computer Science degree. Students who reverted to the B.S. degree program must earn the minimum number of hours and satisfy all degree requirements of whichever version of the B.S. curriculum is appropriate. Graduate credit not used to fulfill the B.S. degree requirements will remain on the transcript and may, at some point, be considered for transfer to another degree program.\nStudents are strongly advised to seek faculty counsel about the 5-year program to be sure they understand the pros and cons of pursuing a Masters's degree via the 5-year program. If they intend to ultimately pursue a Ph.D., then it may be preferable to avoid the rapid pace of the 5-year program and instead invest time in research as an undergraduate. For admission to competitive Ph.D. programs, the expectation of publications and extensive research experience is higher for M.S. graduates. Therefore, as an alternative to the 5-year program, many top students may prefer to conduct research, possibly leading to a B.S. thesis, to improve their admissions chances into top Ph.D. programs.\nDegree Conferral & Commencement\nSee: Fifth Year Master's Degree Conferral & Commencement Policies\nGraduate Academic Office Contact Information\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE\nGraduate Academic Office\nUniversity of Illinois\n201 North Goodwin, 1312 Siebel Center\nUrbana, IL 61801\n\nCampus Mail Code: MC-258\nPhone: (217) 333-4428\nFax: (217) 244-6073\nEmail: academic@cs.illinois.edu\nOFFICE HOURS\nMonday \u2013 Friday\nMorning: 8:00 AM to 11:45 AM\nAfternoon: 1:00 PM to 4:45 PM\nWalk-in advising hours start at 10:00 AM\nList of Graduate Advising Contacts and Virtual Advising Queue"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ican", "data": "HomeAcademicsGraduate AcademicsIllinois Computing Accelerator...\nIllinois Computing Accelerator for Non-Specialists (iCAN)\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nGraduate Academics\nPhD Program\nMS Program\nMS in Bioinformatics Program\nProfessional Master of Computer Science\nFifth Year Master's Programs\nIllinois Computing Accelerator for Non-Specialists (iCAN)\nGraduate Forms & Advising Resources\nCourses\nHonor Code\nStudent Resources\nQUICK LINKS\n  Admissions Q&A Sessions\nIs iCAN Right for You?\nAdmissions Requirements\nApplication Process\niCAN Curriculum\nTuition and Fees\nFAQs\nContact iCAN\nNews\nMeet Our Students\nApplications for the next iCAN cohort will open in October 2023.\n    Is the iCAN Program Right For You?\niCAN is suitable for all non-specialists who want a deeper understanding of computers, algorithms, and programming in order to gain entry into a high-tech career or further their education in a graduate degree program. iCAN students come from all college backgrounds (English, business, marketing, political science, biology, civil engineering) and bring a unique perspective to computing.

We assume and expect that you will behave ethically, honestly, and with the highest degree of integrity befitting a scholar. You are expected to adopt the following Code of Honor to demonstrate your commitment to these principles:\nAs a member of the University of Illinois academic community, I pledge to conduct myself in accordance with the highest standards of academic integrity.\nWhat does this mean? In order to better understand your responsibilities, you should read the rest of this document, which outlines university and CS department policies.\nWhat is Cheating?\nThe University's Student Code, with which all students are expected to be familiar, describes in detail many types of breaches of academic integrity, including cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication, among others. Read Section 1-402 of the Student Code now! Here, we use the term \"cheating\" to mean any of the types of infractions described in the code. You should also become familiar with the Provost\u2019s Quick Reference Guide to Academic Integrity.\nThere are no good reasons to cheat, but there are many reasons not to. Cheating devalues your own degree, and that of others. It is unfair to other students in the class. Often, it sacrifices your own long-term educational goals for perceived short-term gains. You stand a high likelihood of being caught, and receiving a lower grade (perhaps a failing one) in the course. CS students have been expelled from the university for cheating.\nActing Ethically\nActing ethically goes beyond simply \"not cheating\". For example, it is ethical, and important, to report students who you suspect have cheated to your professors - as failure to do so may result in honest students receiving lower grades (in a course that grades on a curve). You are urged to read the ACM Code of Ethics for a more complete description of the high standards set by CS professionals. \nWhat is allowed in CS courses?\nThe university definitions that you've read apply to CS classes, and clearly cover infractions such as copying on exams or written assignments.  For programming assignments, as with most assignments, it is usually fine to discuss the concepts with your classmates (but check the course policy).  A typical course policy might be that when it comes to designing or writing the program (even just the 'pseudo-code'), you must do it yourself, unless the instructor has said otherwise.  \nCertainly, if you are copying text directly from someone else - whether copying files or typing from someone else's notes or typing while they dictate - then you are cheating (committing plagiarism, to be more exact). This is true regardless of whether the source is a classmate, a former student, a website, a program listing found in the trash, or whatever.  And, plagiarism even on a small part of the program is not allowed, nor is starting out with code that you did not write and modifying it to look like your own.\nAs described in the Student Code, aiding someone else's cheating also constitutes cheating. Leaving your program in plain sight or leaving a computer without logging out, thereby leaving your programs open to copying, may constitute cheating depending upon the circumstances. Consequently, you should always take care to prevent others from copying your programs, as it certainly leaves you open to accusations of cheating. If somebody else hands in code identical to yours, you may be penalized!\nFinally, anything written here should not be taken to supercede the particular policies applied by individual professors. It is your responsibility to determine exactly what type of interaction with other people may be allowed, what resources may be consulted, etc., in each of your CS classes. If the course web page does not list a policy, you should ask your instructor to publicize one.\nSanctions\nCheating in Computer Science classes is a serious problem, as it devalues the hard work of honest students. Therefore, the department is determined to eliminate it by making the chances of getting caught high enough, and the sanctions severe enough, that any student considering cheating will choose instead to just do their best, honestly, even if it means a low grade.\nOn our campus, professors have very wide discretion in determining what constitutes cheating in their classes and what sanctions will be applied. However, the department has adopted the following guidelines. Professors are encouraged to apply sanctions at least as severe as these if the facts warrant. You should be sure you understand the particular course policy. (Some course web pages may simply link to this page for the course cheating policy.)\nRecommended sanctions for cheating in a CS course\nFirst offense for cheating:\non an exam: zero on the exam\non a programming assignment, quiz, or written homework: zero on the assignment and final course grade is lowered by one whole letter grade.\nMultiple instances of cheating of any kind: failure in the course.\nOther penalties\nAs noted above, an instructor has wide flexibility in imposing sanctions, and may be either more strict or more lenient than this. Note that all cases in which a student has been found to have committed an infraction of academic integrity are reported to the CS department, to the student's college, and to the Senate Committee on Student Discipline.\nDepartmental penalties.\nIf a student is found cheating in different courses, in the same course in different semesters, or in particularly egregious cases, the department will consider the case for possible additional penalties including suspension or dismissal from the university. Similarly, the college, or university may take action beyond the instructor's penalty, including suspension or dismissal.\nProcedures\nThe procedures to be followed by instructor and student in cases of \"infractions of academic integrity\" are laid out in the Campus Code. It is somewhat dense reading, but the basics are these (refer to the link above for the definitive version):\nUsing the Faculty Academic Integrity Reporting portal (\"FAIR\") at my.cs.illinois.edu/fair, the instructor sends a message informing the student that s/he is being accused of cheating.\nThe student has ten business days to respond, also using the FAIR portal. Failure to respond within the ten days will be taken as an admission of the maximum level of culpability.\nAfter considering the student's response, the instructor will make a timely decision in the case, and if he or she still believes there has been an infraction, will impose a sanction via the FAIR portal.\nIf the instructor finds that the student has committed an infraction, then the student has the right to appeal the decision within five business days, by contacting the director of undergraduate programs (currently egunter@cs.illinois.edu). In some cases, the situation can be negotiated and resolved without a hearing, but most appeals are heard by a departmental committee.\nIt is important to use the FAIR portal, because it tracks the deadlines, notifies the students of their rights in the process, and notifies the appropriate administrative offices of a pending or completed case. However, many instructors and students find it helpful to discuss the issues directly with each other, and this \"off-portal\" communication is fine, perhaps encouraged, but ultimately the FAIR portal must be used, even if to simply summarize what the student and instructor have discussed."}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/research", "data": "HomeResearch\nResearch\nResearch Overview\nIllinois-Insper Partnership\nNSF Expeditions in Computing: Mind in Vitro\nResearch Areas\nSpeaker Series\nCorporate Partners\nResearch Overview\nSummer Research\nResearch Opportunities for Undergraduates\nIllinois Computer Science has a global reputation for developing revolutionary technology \u2014 where groundbreaking research addresses real-world problems.

Natural language processing systems understand written and spoken language; possibilities include automatic translation of text from one language to another, or understanding text on Wikipedia to produce knowledge about the world. Machine listening systems understand audio signals, with applications like speech recognition, acoustic monitoring, or transcribing polyphonic music automatically. Crucial to modern artificial intelligence, machine learning methods exploit examples in order to adjust systems to work as effectively as possible. Robotics puts artificial intelligence into practice using machines that perceive and interact with the physical world.\nStrengths and Impact\nThe AI group at Illinois is strong, diverse, and growing.

Interactive computing studies how computers and people can cooperate effectively on any number of tasks.\nOur work targets problems in social computing, design and creativity, decision making, intelligent systems, and cognitive modeling. For example, we study the transparency of algorithms controlling social media feeds, the use of robotics in domestic environments to support aging in place, and the application of crowdsourcing for creative work. Working at times with companies like Adobe, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, NVidia, and Tableau, our research synthesizes knowledge from machine learning, psychology, design, and the learning sciences to study and address important problems in society. We also work on the presentation of and interaction with information, ranging from dashboards of visualizations to VR displays of photorealistic video games.\nStrengths and Impact\nThe interactive computing area comprises scholars with diverse preparation, methodologies, and perspectives spanning interaction design, visualization, applied machine learning, decision sciences, and social computing. These scholars share the common goal of designing computational artifacts and developing pedagogy to address important questions that arise when algorithms mediate (and influence) individual and group decision-making; team formation or collectives; interaction design; and mechanisms that influence online behavioral norms. The group\u2019s intellectual diversity is critical to address these questions, provides group synergies, and facilitates meaningful collaboration with scholars across other units across campus.\nGroundbreaking Research\nAwards\nPublic Engagement\nResearch Efforts and Groups\nCenter for People and Infrastructure in the Coordinated Science Laboratory\nComputer Graphics Illinois\nIllinois HCI\n  Seminars\nThe HCI seminar brings in emerging and established intellectual leaders in the field of human-computer interaction to present their latest research findings and visions.

Gillies Memorial Lecture\nEquity & Justice in Computing Lectures\nRobert Mueller-Thuns Lecture\nThe Utpal Banerjee Distinguished Lecture Series in High Performance Computing\nAn adjunct professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, Utpal Banerjee spent nearly 20 years of his career at Intel in the Software Solutions Group, where he developed techniques to enhance the performance of multi-core processors.\nUtpal Banerjee\nIn the early days of parallel computing while working as a graduate student for Illinois CS Professor David Kuck, Banerjee developed a strategy for automatically analyzing a loop and determining whether it could be executed in parallel. His method, later dubbed Banerjee\u2019s test, was a simple, fast, and effective data dependence test that has been widely used for compiler development and has had a big impact on advancing compiler technology.\nWhile at Intel, he developed a formal representation and generalization of loop transformation techniques. By formalizing the transformation of code, Banerjee created the foundations of modern work on program restructuring, which is now known as the polyhedron model. In the 1990s, he wrote several books on loop dependence and transformations for restructuring compilers. Banerjee is a fellow of ACM and IEEE.\nWhen Utpal Banerjee died in 2017, members of his family said they were only beginning to understand the impact the Illinois Computer Science alumnus had on high performance computing. As a result, his daughter, Sanchita Banerjee Saxena, and her family have established the Utpal Banerjee Distinguished Lecture Series in High Performance Computing. Through their gift they are able to both honor his memory and provide a platform for the department to showcase one of the areas in which it excels, and to remember one of its own in a lasting way.\nBanerjee Lecturers\nTitle Date Speaker\nOptimizing a Computation April 14, 2022 David J.

Gillies Memorial Lecture\nNews Overview\nDonor Profiles\nMedia Coverage\nE-News\nImpact Report & Publications\nSpeaker Series\nBanerjee Lecture\nDonald B. Gillies Memorial Lecture\nEquity & Justice in Computing Lectures\nRobert Mueller-Thuns Lecture\nThe Donald B. Gillies Memorial Lectureship in Computer Science was established at the University of Illinois through memorial gifts by family and friends, with a major contribution by the Digital Equipment Corporation.\nProfessor Gillies, a native of Canada, did his undergraduate work at the University of Toronto, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1953. While in graduate school he worked as a graduate assistant at the Institute for Advanced Study with John von Neumann in the fields of game theory and computer science. Before coming to the University of Illinois in 1956, he spent two years with the National Research Development Corporation at Cambridge University and London, England. He was among the first mathematicians to become involved in the computer field, helping to calculate the first Sputnik orbit and later discovering three new prime numbers in the course of checking out ILLIAC II. (For nearly a decade, the latter was commemorated by the Mathematics Department with a postage mark stamped on all outgoing mail.) Before his death in 1975, he was experimenting with educational uses and networking possibilities of minicomputers.\nDonald Gillies\nAlthough a lifelong stutter affected his class lectures, Gillies was an inspiration to his students, taking an interest in both their professional and personal lives. Long before timesharing terminals, minicomputers and microprocessors made \u201chands on\u201d computer experience commonplace, he recognized the need for students to have this opportunity and implemented a system to provide it. For example, during a family vacation to Canada, he picked up a newly developed Fortran compiler from the University of Waterloo so it could be implemented at Illinois, his son Don (MS CS '90, PhD CS '93) recalled. With its quick turnaround capabilities, this compiler enabled the university to offer programming classes to non-CS students for the first time. \nThroughout his work and teaching he stressed the importance of the ethical use of computing machines in contemporary science. Dedicated to the honest uses of technology, environmentally concerned, a man of wit, vigor and understanding, he challenged and stimulated all who knew him.\nIt is hoped that the Donald B. Gillies Lectureship in Computer Science will continue to enrich the lives of students and colleagues as an appropriate memorial to a man whose intellectual excellence and moral purpose made him a distinguished teacher and scientist.\nPast Lecturers\nSystems Research - Construed Broadly Dec. 3, 2019 Margo I.

Do More.\nmueller-thuns lecture logo: think more, learn more, do more.\nThe Robert Mueller-Thuns Lectureship in Computer Science was established at the University of Illinois through memorial gifts by his wife, Nikki Mueller-Thuns Mirghafori (BS '91), family, friends, and colleagues.\nRobert Mueller-Thuns\nRobert was born in Bonn, Germany and did his undergraduate work at the Technical University of Aachen, Germany. He attended University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1986 to 1990, where he received both his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science. While in graduate school, he held internships at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, followed by positions at Cadence Design Systems and TCSI Corporation post-graduation. At the time of his untimely death at the age of 37, he was a Software Architect at Evolve Corporation, a start-up in San Francisco, CA. His areas of expertise were computer-aided design for VLSI, simulation, testing, parallel processing, formal design verification, as well as object oriented analysis and design, and pattern languages.\nRobert was a remarkable human being: a gentle spirit with an insatiable intellectual curiosity and zest for life. Aside from being a researcher and computer scientist, he was a musician, an athlete, and a writer. He had a passion for thinking, ideas, and learning, as well as for living life through friendship, music, food, and travel. Even as he battled cancer, he never lost his optimism, sense of humor, and vitality. In the words of Paul Chen (PhD EE '93), a close friend: \"Robert was known by his Illini friends as The Uberman, partly because of his German ethnicity, and partly because he was an amazing individual\u2014someone whom we respected and admired for his ability to achieve excellence in all that he did. He had a passion for living. And he excelled in life: the Uberman could out-almost-anything us, all the while smiling effortlessly and encouragingly at us lesser mortals.\"\nRobert thrived and made life-long friends at Illinois and it is hoped that the Mueller-Thuns Lectureship in Computer Science will give the chance to others at Illinois to think more, learn more, and do more as an appropriate memorial to a man whose intellectual intensity, integrity, and vibrancy made him an inspiration to all who knew him.\nMueller-Thuns Lecturers\nTitle Date Speaker\nFrom Robots to Biomolecules: Computing in the Physical World November 18, 2019 Lydia E.

Specific application areas currently include:\n1) Development and application of new statistical and machine learning  techniques to large astrophysical data. Specific algorithms currently include random forests, random atlas, hierarchical Bayesian estimation, and deep neural networks, while specific application areas include source classification, image classification, and distance estimation.\n2) Development and application of new cosmological measurement codes, in particular n-point clustering measurements and the quantifying the constraints these new measurements place on cosmological parameters and our understanding of the growth of large scale structure. \n3) Acceleration of learning and cosmological measurement codes by using new hardware technologies. Currently these efforts focus on the use of multi- and many-core systems, GPUs, and cloud-based systems.\n4) Identification and characterization of transient and variable phenomena in large photometric and spectroscopic data.\nThese projects primarily use photometric and spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, and the Dark Energy Survey, as well as several space-based surveys. Many of the techniques developed are also applicable to the design and operation of the forthcoming large synoptic survey telescope.\n  Research Areas\nData and Information Systems\nScientific Computing\nRecent Courses Taught\nACCY 199 - Technology and Disruption\nACCY 570 - Data Analytics Foundations\nACCY 571 - Stat Analyses for Accountancy\nBDI 199 - Technology and Disruption\nBDI 411 - Blockchain Applications\nClick for more\nRelated News"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/caesar", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nMatthew Caesar\nMatthew Caesar\nProfessor\n(847) 323-2968\ncaesar@illinois.edu\n3118 Siebel Center for Comp Sci\nFor More Information\nMatthew Caesar's home page\nEducation\nPh.D., Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, 2007\nResearch Interests\nSimplifying management and improving reliability of distributed systems and networks through principles of self-organization and self-diagnosis, with an emphasis on wide-area networks and networked systems.\nMy research focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of distributed systems and networks on the extremely large scale, with an emphasis on network operations, measurement, and availability.

He did postdoctoral training with Ben Raphael at Brown University and Princeton University (2014-2017). In 2018, he joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science. El-Kebir has affiliate faculty appointments in Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Institute of Genomic Biology and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. He received the National Science Foundation CISE Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) Award in 2019 and the CAREER Award in 2021.\nEl-Kebir's main research is in combinatorial optimization algorithms for problems in computational biology, with a particular focus on cancer genomics. Among his major contributions are advances in the theoretical foundations of cancer phylogenetics (e.g., hardness proofs for phylogeny estimation problems from mixture data), methods for the estimation of cancer phylogenies from sequencing data of tumors, and new mathematical models for studying cancer evolution and metastasis.\nEl-Kebir's current focus is on developing methods that enable the estimation of cancer phylogenies from single-cell sequencing data. A specific challenge he is addressing is the integration of data obtained from the same tumor using distinct single-cell technologies. Another focus is the development of comprehensive evolutionary models for somatic mutations that occur at varying genomic scales. More generally, El-Kebir is developing novel problem statements and corresponding methods to analyze omics data in novel ways, thereby improving scientific discovery.\nAcademic Positions\nAssistant Professor (affiliate), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Institute of Genomic Biology, 2018-Present\nAssistant Professor (affiliate), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2018-Present\nAssistant Professor (affiliate), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, National Center of Supercomputing Applications, 2018-Present\nAssistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Computer Science, 2018-Present\nPostdoc, Princeton University, Department of Computer Science, 2016-2017\nResearch Interests\nCombinatorial optimization and its applications to cancer and infection genomics\nResearch Areas\nBioinformatics and Computational Biology\nTheory and Algorithms\nSelected Articles in Journals\nM.

They are all around us---from the datacenters and clouds we use directly or indirectly every day; to smart devices, smart homes, and smart buildings/cities; to machine learning running inside AI systems online and in the physical world. Yet many common concepts, algorithms, and systems design and implementation techniques, pervade and permeate through many of these seemingly disparate types of distributed systems. Prof. Indranil Gupta (Indy) does research and teaching on these topics. His research is driven by a love of working on real problems (very often motivated by industry), devising solutions with intellectual depth, and then implementing and evaluating them with real testbeds and systems. He also collaborates with industry production teams. His group is one of the most diverse in the CS department. He teaches the world's largest (online) class on distributed systems, apart from regular on-campus teaching. Sometimes he improvises music to teach Computer Science.\nIn Detail:\nProf. Indranil Gupta (Indy) is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Indy leads the Distributed Protocols Research Group in the CS Department at UIUC. He is interested in research on distributed systems, with specific focus on large-scale distributed systems such as datacenters. cloud computing systems, IoT, Distributed Machine Learning, etc. Indranil Gupta is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and IEEE Senior Member. Indranil is recipient of the the NSF CAREER award in 2005, the Junior Xerox Award for Faculty Research in 2008, the CAS/Beckman Fellowship in 2009, and the Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Faculty Fellowship in 2010. He has won Best Paper Awards at IEEE IC2E 2018, IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2017, IEEE IC2E 2016, IEEE ICAC 2015 and BigMine 2012. Indranil has received teaching recognition in the UIUC \"List of Teachers ranked as Excellent\" multiple times since 2003. He served as General Chair of ACM PODC 2007; PC co-chair at multiple conferences over the years (Usenix HotCloud 2018, IEEE IC2E 2017, LADIS 2017, IEEE ICCAC 2016, ACM DeMiST 2016, IEEE P2P 2014, ACM/IFIP/Usenix Middleware 2010, IEEE SASO 2010 and StoDiS 2005). He is on the editorial board for both ACM TAAS (Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems) and IEEE TCC (Transactions on Cloud Computing). Previously, Indranil received his PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University in 2004. He has worked at Google (2011-12), IBM Research (T.J. Watson) and Microsoft Research (Cambridge, UK). Indranil obtained his Bachelor of Technology (Computer Science) from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Chennai/Madras, in 1998.\nIndy is a world leader in inventing and implementing novel systems techniques that make distributed systems more reliable, predictable, and manageable. These include contributions and interests in both: a) core Distributed Systems topics, as well as b) Distributed Systems + X topics. Core distributed systems topics include batch processing, stream processing, and distributed storage---in all these areas his work has solved problems faced by open-source distributed systems used widely in industry. In the past he has worked on peer to peer systems, and nature-inspired distributed systems. Distributed Systems + X topics include collaborations and research results in Distributed Machine Learning, Distributed Systems + IoT, verification of Distributed Systems, and others. Prof. Gupta also collaborates with industry, contributing to their production systems as well as helping shine light on their production systems. His research results are in use by multiple prominent companies. Prof. Gupta runs one of the most diverse groups in the CS department---about 50% of his PhD students are women.\nFor more research information, papers, slides, and software see the website of Prof. Gupta's \"Distributed Protocols Research Group\" (DPRG): http://dprg.cs.uiuc.edu/\nProf. Indranil Gupta (Indy) is also a leader in democratizing the teaching of distributed systems. He teaches the world's largest (online) course on Distributed Systems. Offered via Coursera, his \"Cloud Computing Concepts\" courses (Parts 1 and 2) together have about 100k students annually, and are used by companies, startups, and taken by students of all generations, across 198 countries. In addition, Indy loves teaching in the classroom and handles classes of up to 500 students per semester, who are all excited to learn about distributed systems!\nSince you made it this far in the bio (or perhaps you jumped ahead strategically---either way, nice work!), you get a prize! Did you know that Indy has a Youtube channel where he improvises songs to teach Distributed Systems concepts and on topics related to CS Research?

Eng. & Comp. Sc., MIT, 1996\nBiography\nMark Hasegawa-Johnson has been on the faculty at the University of Illinois since 1999, where he is currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  He received his Ph.D. in 1996 at MIT, with a thesis titled \"Formant and Burst Spectral Measures with Quantitative Error Models for Speech Sound Classification,\" after which he was a post-doc at UCLA from 1996-1999.  Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson is a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America (2011, for contributions to vocal tract and speech modeling) and a Fellow of the IEEE (2020, for contributions to speech processing of under-resourced languages).  He is currently Senior Area Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language, and a member of the ISCA Diversity Committee.  He has published 308 peer-reviewed journal articles, patents and conference papers in the general area of automatic speech analysis, including machine learning models of articulatory and acoustic phonetics, prosody, dysarthria, non-speech acoustic events, audio source separation, and under-resourced languages.\nTeaching Statement\nProfessor Hasegawa-Johnson typically teaches Artificial Intelligence (CS 440/ECE 448), Multimedia Signal Processing (ECE 417), Speech Processing (ECE 537), and Speech and Image Analysis (ECE 401).  He has also taught Digital Signal Processing (ECE 551), Audio Engineering (ECE 403), Pattern Recognition (ECE 544NA), and Probability (ECE 313).\nResearch Statement\nDr. Hasegawa-Johnson's research is focused on the area of automatic speech recognition, with a particular focus on the mathematization of linguistic concepts. In the past five years, Dr. Hasegawa-Johnson's group has developed mathematical models of concepts from linguistics including a rudimentary model of pre-conscious speech perception (the landmark-based speech recognizer), a model that interprets pronunciation variability by figuring out how the talker planned his or her speech movements (tracking of tract variables from acoustics, and of gestures from tract variables), and a model that uses the stress and rhythm of natural language (prosody) to disambiguate confusable sentences. Recent application successes include:\n* Speech recognition for talkers with cerebral palsy. The automatic system, suitably constrained, outperforms a human listener.\n* Retrieval of broadcast television segments in four languages, based on queries specified in the international phonetic alphabet. The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took third place in this international competition, and was the only finalist from the United States.\n* Automatic detection and labeling of non-speech audio events. The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took first place in this international competition.\n* Teaching Chinese. Software and methods developed by Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson, together with his colleagues from Linguistics and Psychology, are being tested in Mandarin language classrooms at the University of Illinois.\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities\nProfessor Hasegawa-Johnson typically supervises one or two undergraduate research projects per year, thesis research preferred. Past student theses include automatic recognition of musical genre, factorial HMMs for the automatic recognition of speech in music backgrounds, prosody-dependent speech recognition, image source modeling of room impulse response, sonorancy classification for automatic language ID, phonetic landmark detection for automatic language ID, and digital field recorder for acquisition of a natural audio database.\nResearch Interests\nAcoustic phonetics, Audio signal processing and speech recognition, Speech and auditory physiology.\nResearch Areas\nArtificial Intelligence\nHonors\nFellow of the IEEE, 2020, for contributions to speech processing of under-resourced languages\nFellow of the Acoustical Society of America, 2011, for contributions to vocal tract and speech modeling\nResearch Honors\nIndividual National Research Service Award, National Institutes of Health, 1998-1999.\nFrederic Vinton Hunt Post-Doctoral Fellowship, Acoustical Society of America, 1996-1997.\nPaul L.

May 2003. Advisor: David B. Johnson. Dissertation: Enabling Secure High-Performance Wireless Ad Hoc Networking.\nResearch Statement\nMy general research interests are in security and systems, with emphasis on the areas of secure systems and mobile communications. I have published papers in the areas of secure Internet routing, secure routing in wireless ad hoc networks, security and anonymity in peer-to-peer networks, efficient cryptographic mechanisms for routing security, and design and evaluation of ad hoc network routing protocols. In my future research, I will continue to build new systems with lightweight and minimally intrusive security. I will build systems that preserve privacy and anonymity in wireless networks to overcome attackers that can correlate individual wireless transmissions. In environments where user cooperation can be a public good, I will design techniques that incentivize user cooperation while minimizing the impact of malicious players. I will design and use evaluation frameworks that objectively, quantifiably, and rigorously measure the performance of secure systems under attack. I will also build backwards-compatible, incrementally-deployable lightweight security mechanisms for widely-deployed protocols with insufficient security.\nResearch Interests\nVehicular Networks\nWireless Networks\nPrivacy in Wireless Networks\nNetwork Security\nResearch Areas\nSystems and Networking\nRecent Courses Taught\nECE 198 YH - Comp Apps-Discrete Mathematics\nECE 220 - Computer Systems & Programming\nECE 391 - Computer Systems Engineering\nECE 428 - Distributed Systems\nRelated News"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yunhuang", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nYun Huang\nYun Huang\nAssociate Professor, Information Sciences\nyunhuang@illinois.edu\n236 Grad Sch of Lib & Info Science\nResearch Areas\nInteractive Computing\nRecent Courses Taught\nIS 226 - Introduction to HCI\nIS 424 - Social Computing\nIS 455 - Database Design & Prototyping\nIS 490 - Social Computing\nIS 496 - Design for Social Interact Exp\nRelated News\nNew AI Institute to Focus On the Speech Language Pathology Needs of Children"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/jianh", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nJian Huang\nJian Huang\nAssistant Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(217) 300-3104\njianh@illinois.edu\n212 Coordinated Science Lab\nFor More Information\nSystems Platform Research Group\nJian's research homepage\nEducation\nGeorgia Institute of Technology; Ph.D., Computer Science; August 2017.\nProfessional Highlights\n[Research] As of July 2023, I have published 40+ papers at a variety of the strongest computer architecture and systems conferences in my field, including ASPLOS, MICRO, ISCA, OSDI, SOSP, PLDI, FAST, EuroSys, and USENIX ATC, and a dozen patents issued worldwide.

He previously served as acting head of Illinois's Human Factors program in the Institute of Aviation from 2006-2010. Alex earned his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Industrial & Systems Engineering (Human-Machine Systems) at The Ohio State University. His Ph.D. thesis, \"The organization of perception and action in complex control skills\" earned the George Briggs Award from APA's Division of Applied Experimental and Engineering Psychologists, as the best dissertation of the year. During his academic career, in addition to positions held with his home institutions at the University of Illinois (2002-date) and Georgia Tech (1989-2001), Alex has held visiting positions at Stanford University and NASA Ames Research Center (ASEE-NASA Stanford Summer Faculty Fellow, 1989, 1990), Yale University, Haskins Laboratory and the University of Connecticut (Visiting Scholar, 2001-02 academic year), Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, MA (Sabbatical Research, 2012-13 academic year), and the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety (Visiting Scholar, summer 2015).\nAlex's research interests include human-computer interaction, human factors, visual analytics to support judgment and decision making, human-robot interaction, social computing, human-automation interaction and decision support is sociotechnical systems such as aviation, space, intelligence analysis, severe weather forecasting, disaster and emergency response, healthcare and medicine, autonomous vehicles, education and so forth.\nTeaching Statement\nAlex's approach to teaching and mentoring students is naturally dependent of the level of instruction involved. Perhaps one notable aspect of his educational approach is that no crisp line can be drawn between his interests and activities in research and teaching. For example, he has advised 3 PhD dissertations on the development and evaluation of new techniques and technologies for teaching engineering design.\nHis research and educational activities also dovetail in the realm of his graduate seminars, which are intensively group- and project-based, typically involving students in actual research projects to motivate and animate the course material. For example, in 2010 Alex seized on an opportunity afforded by a U.S. \u201cChallenge.gov\u201d Health and Human Services competition that required competing project teams to design a Facebook app that would be useful to people in the aftermath of natural disasters and emergencies. This project not only involved the students, working as a design team, to create a conceptual design for the app, but to also create a working software prototype and a video demo. The competition was open to any group who wanted to enter \u2013 it was not specifically targeted to the educational community or to educational institutions. The students\u2019 design earned 3rd place nationally: www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/02/20120223b.html\nResearch Statement\nAlex Kirlik\u2019s research program in human-computer interaction, human factors, and cognitive science & engineering has focused on understanding and supporting the cognition (judgment, decision making, prediction, problem solving and system control), of professionals working in technological workplaces, operational contexts and sociotechnical systems. His research contributing to commercial aviation safety in both airborne and ground operations has been supported by NASA for over 25 years.\nRecently, aspects of these lines of research have matured into NSF- and NASA-sponsored multidisciplinary projects, joint with collaborators in aerospace, mechanical and software engineering, to create and evaluate formal techniques and general principles for the design of safe and robust cyber-physical-human systems comprised of people and hardware and software automation: Engineering Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) Systems. The aim of this research, which is relevant to applications not solely in aviation but in contexts such as healthcare and highways, is to achieve levels of human-automation system performance, robustness and safety exceeding what would be achievable by either a human or automation acting alone. A 5-minute public video demo illustrating this work in an aviation context is available at: www.youtube.com/watch. \nA second major thrust of Alex's research concerns support for judgment and decision making in high-stakes tasks. This line of research developed into an NSF-sponsored project to develop and evaluate quantitative models of judgment in technological systems (e.g., KIrlik, 2006, Adaptive Perspectives on Human-Technology Interaction, NY: Oxford; see: www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780195171822/).\n. Recently, he and his multi-disciplinary team began a 3-year research project involving the design and use of domestic, aerial and ground robotics to support aging-in-place called ASPIRE: Automation Supporting Prolonged Independent Residence for the Elderly, sponsored by the National Robotics Initiative.  A brief video showing progress to date, presented at the October, 2016 \"Aging 2.0\" conference in San Francisco can be viewed at: \nAlso, Alex has co-edited (with J.D. Lee) the first authoritative handbook of its kind, The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Engineering, representing the contributions of more than 60 of the discipline\u2019s most influential and accomplished researchers:\n    Undergraduate Research Opportunities\nAlex often has paid or for-credit undergraduate research opportunities in both human-computer interaction and human factors.\nResearch Areas\nHuman-Computer Interaction\nVisualization\nBooks Edited or Co-Edited (Original Editions)\nLee, J.D. & Kirlik, A.

For example when I received my B. E. in Precision Machinery and Instrumentation from the Univ. of Science and Technology of China I didn\u2019t expect at all I would get my PhD from MIT in the area of computer aided design for 3-D Printing\u2014 because there was not even AutoCAD in my college years.\nAfter my doctoral studies, I was drawn to the area of Biomedical research due to both my interest in helping cure diseases and my new found faith. In the years I spent in Boston Longwood Area, I have done research in diverse Data Science related areas such as Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Biostatistics, and Machine learning.\nOver a 4-year period of encountering/interacting with students, reviewing academic works and college teaching, I discovered I feel happiest when I work with undergraduate students and I enjoy teaching undergraduate students and training next generation of computer scientists and data-centered professionals. I am passionate about mentoring undergraduate students and helping undergraduate students do research. My research is focused on understanding the needs of students with disabilities and broadening the participation of students with disabilities. I am currently PI of two projects at the Univ. of Illinois on helping students with disabilities and PI of a project on exploring UDL in teaching STEM courses. The projects are: SIIP project \"UDL based best practices including utilizing Canvas for the needs of students with disability\"; GIANT project \"Applying a Theoretical Understanding of Text-Based Learning Modalities To Develop New Course Modalities That Meet the Needs of Student With Disabilities\".\nOther interests include Biomedical applications that involve large high dimensional data analysis and machine learning and data-driven educational improvement for undergraduate students.\nProfessional Highlights\nI have been part of the faculty spotlight demonstrating active learning methods by the SIIP ENGINE project https://publish.illinois.edu/siipcompendium/2021/10/11/faculty-spotlight-hongye-liu/\nResearch Areas\nBioinformatics and Computational Biology\nComputers and Education\nChapters in Books\nSpringer Handbook of Bio-/Neuroinformatics 2014, pp 43-55 Information Processing at the Genomics Level.

It looks at the fundamental solution concepts from economics, game theory, and social choice from the computational lens. I am also interested in understanding questions related to fairness in society, and evolution in nature.\nMy main research interests lie in the areas of algorithmic game theory, mathematical economics, and in design of efficient algorithms. I am interested in exploring the computability of equilibria, both market and Nash, under various settings, and also understanding the impact of strategic behavior in multi-agent situations. Currently, I am exploring problems from dynamic matching, fair division of scarce resources, and market design for cloud computing. In addition I am exploring avenues for interdisciplinary applications of these tools to genetic evolution, machine learning and dynamical systems.\nResearch Interests\nAlgorithmic Game Theory: Equilibrium Computation and Complexity, Smoothed Analysis, Learning in Games, Strategic and Dynamic Aspects\nFair division\nInterdisciplinary applications of game-theoretic tools to machine learning, genetic evolution, and climate change.\nResearch Areas\nTheory and Algorithms\nSelected Articles in Journals\nA simplex-like algorithm for linear Fisher markets.

We use techniques from theoretical computer science and control theory.\nGraduate Research Opportunities\nWe are looking for graduate students with background in CS theory (formal methods, logic, automata theory, algorithms) and/or control theory. Solid programming skills & other mathematical background (e.g. stochastic processes) would be a plus. As an graduate researcher you will develop new verification and synthesis algorithms, build tools, and perform experiments in using these tools on real systems.\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities\nWe are looking for juniors/seniors with solid programming skills (E.g., C/C++, Java, Matlab) and who intend to go to grad school in one of the related research areas. Preference will be given to those who can commit to working at least 6-8 hours a week for a couple of semesters. You will work closely with one of the graduate students towards developing software tools or applying them to verify a systems. This typically leads to an undergraduate thesis or publishable work.

This has had a tremendous impact in academia (see Wikipedia page entries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_word ). This has not just been widely cited, but has defined a new model that people have extensively studied (see http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&as_oq=%22nested+words%22+%22visibly+pushdown%22 for a Google Scholar search for \"nested words\" OR \"visibly pushdown\" that lists more than 940 entries). The class of visibly pushdown languages is an insertion into the Chomsky hierarchy, falling between regular languages and deterministic context-free languages, but which possesses most closure properties that regular languages have while yet remaining tractable. In particular, the inclusion problem is decidable and this has led to applications ranging from XML processing to program verification to programming languages.\nResearch Interests\nReasoning with heaps in software verification (Natural proofs, Strand, separation logic);\nSoftware Verification; Reliable and secure software engineering; Security; Program Synthesis; Logic and Automata Theory.\nResearch Areas\nProgramming Languages / Formal Methods / Software Engineering\nArticles in Conference Proceedings\nFaria Kalim, Karl Palmskog, Jayasi Mehar, Adithya Murali, Indranil Gupta, P.

Before joining Illinois, Jian was a postdoc at CSAIL at MIT and a visiting scientist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago in 2013. His research interests include bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and machine learning. Algorithms developed by Jian and his co-workers were successful in several scientific challenges, including the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competitions and a few DREAM challenges on translational medicine and pharmacogenomics. Recently, Jian has received the Overton Prize, an NSF CAREER Award, a PhRMA Foundation Award, and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship.\nAcademic Positions\nAssociate Professor, Department of Computer Science\nResearch Statement\n1. Computational Molecular and Systems Biology\nProtein structure, interaction, and function are by nature intertwined, with structure, or structural properties, playing a large role in defining the function and understanding human diseases. As such, determining protein structure has been one of the most important challenges in biology. In parallel, given the many obstacles to experimental structure determination, computational prediction of protein structure remains one of the longest-standing challenges in computational biology. My group has developed a number of machine learning algorithms to tackle this problem. In particular, DeepContact, an approach that employs deep learning for protein contact prediction, has achieved substantial improvement over previous approaches, highlighted by its performance (as a co-winner) in the most recent Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP12) in 2016. In another recent work, we developed DeepSignal, a recurrent neural network model to study protein function, such as phosphorylation and motif binding. Applied to the cellular signaling system, DeepSignal not only improves the prediction but also enable mutational analysis for studying the functional variants in human diseases, such as cancer. We have then extended the model for other types of protein-substrate interactions, including protein-RNA binding and protein-peptide binding. Most recently, we developed a deep-learning model to integrate evolutionary representations for efficient protein design and engineering.\nMoving from individual molecules, a systematic understanding of their interactions and functions, from heterogeneous datasets, is critical for both biological and translational medicine research. I have been developing efficient machine learning algorithms, especially integrative manifold learning algorithms, to extract information from various interactomic datasets. My algorithm, Mashup, takes full advantage of network-specific topology by learning a canonical representation that best integrates the topological patterns across multiple biological networks. Its substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art methods in distinct functional inference tasks demonstrate its applicability to effectively deciphering functional properties of genes from interactomes. Based on Mashup, my group has developed generalized versions to incorporate other data types, including text, homology, and structures\n2. Pharmacogenomics and Human Disease Genomics\nComputational prediction of drug\u2013target interactions (DTIs) has become an important step in the drug discovery or repositioning process, aiming to identify putative new drugs or novel targets for existing drugs to accelerate drug discovery. Collaborating with biologists, my group has developed DTINet based on Mashup that integrates diverse drug information for DTI prediction. Validated on benchmarks and by experiments, DTINet offers a practical and accurate tool to predict unknown DTIs, which may provide new insights into drug discovery or repositioning. Furthermore, I have been working with doctors and medical researchers, applying my algorithms to studying human diseases. In a recent Cell Systems article, we systematically mapped molecular pathways underlying the toxicity of alpha-synuclein, a protein central to Parkinson\u2019s disease. To translate findings from yeast screens, we developed a computational method to integrates a Steiner prize-collecting approach with homology assignment through Mashup integration with sequence, structure, and interaction topology. This work has been featured as the cover article in the issue and received multiple highlights in media and a Bishop Dr. Karl Golser Paper Award. Based on the network, we have performed a high-depth exome-capture of these genes in 500 patients with synucleinopathy and identified novel rare variants that are enriched in carriers of mutations in LRRK2 and GBA. Collaborating with researchers from UCSD School of Medicine, we have identified a novel way to stratify cancer patients by their tumor mutations using networks.\n3. Data Analytics and Machine Learning\nIn addition to bioinformatics problems, we have been working on developing new machine learning algorithms for data analysis and deep reinforcement learning algorithms for process optimization of scientific experiments. Collaborating with chemists, we have been developing a fully automated molecular synthesis system powered by deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms.\nResearch Areas\nBioinformatics and Computational Biology\nHonors\nNSF CAREER Award (2017)\nPhRMA Foundation Award in Informatics (2017)\nNCSA Faculty Fellowship (2016)\nSloan Research Fellowship (2016)\nRecent Courses Taught\nCS 466 - Introduction to Bioinformatics\nCS 598 JP - Machine Lrning Computation Bio\nRelated News\nDeepMind Has Predicted the Structure of Almost Every Protein Known to Science\nAI-Driven Pharmaceutics Company Helixon Raise CNY 500 Mn (USD $74.35 Million) in Series A Round\nIllinois, IBM Ready to Push the Boundaries of What's Possible in Computing\nDeep-Learning Algorithm Aims to Accelerate Protein Engineering\nIllinois CS Professors Earn C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute Grants in AI for Energy and Climate Security\nPeng's Collaborative Work in Crop Prediction Earns HPC Innovation Excellence Award"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/pitt", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nLeonard B Pitt\nLeonard B Pitt\nProfessor Emeritus\npitt@illinois.edu\n3237 Siebel Center for Comp Sci\nResearch Areas\nTheory and Algorithms\nRecent Courses Taught\nCS 100 - Freshman Orientation\nRelated News\nPitt Prepares To Depart Illinois CS, the Department He Helped Shape Over Three Decades\nU.

Behavioral development occurs in many animals, including humans. As animals age and pass through different life stages, their genetically determined behavioral responses to environmental and social stimuli change in predictable ways. Often these responses increase in complexity and involve learning. Our research is designed to explain the function and evolution of behavioral mechanisms that integrate the activity of individuals in a society, neural and neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate behavior within the brain of the individual, and the genes that influence social behavior.\nRecent Courses Taught\nIB 299 - Training in Team Science\nIB 546 - Topics in Ecology & Evolution\nMCB 199 - Training in Team Science\nRelated News"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/tringer", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nTalia Ringer\nTalia Ringer they/them/theirs\nAssistant Professor\ntringer@illinois.edu\n4218 Siebel Center for Comp Sci\nFor More Information\nTalia Ringer's GitHub\nTalia Ringer's website\nEducation\nUniversity of Washington, Ph.D. in Computer Science, 2021\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park, B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science, 2012\nBiography\nHow can we build a world in which programmers of all skill levels across all domains can prove the absence of costly or dangerous bugs in software systems---that is, formally verify them? I am an Assistant Professor with the PL/FM/SE group at Illinois, and I like to build proof engineering technologies to make that world a reality. In so doing, I love to use the whole toolbox---everything from dependent type theory to program transformations to neural proof synthesis---all in service of real humans.\nPrior to Illinois, I earned my PhD in 2021 from the University of Washington, working with the wonderful PLSE group. Prior to graduate school, I earned my BS in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Maryland, then worked as a software engineer at Amazon for three years.\nI am extremely passionate about building a welcoming environment for students. I am founder and chair of the SIGPLAN long-term mentoring committee (called SIGPLAN-M), an international long-term cross-institutional mentoring program for aspiring and current programming languages researchers spanning dozens of countries and reaching hundreds of mentees around the world. I am also the founder and president of the Computing Connections Fellowship, a fellowship that provides institution-independent transitional funding for computer science Ph.D. students who need help escaping unhealthy environments.\nI am openly bisexual and prefer they/them pronouns; I am always happy to talk to LGBTQ students. I am also very open about my experiences with mental illness, and very happy to talk to anyone who needs an ear (though students should keep in mind that I am a mandatory reporter through Title IX).\nAcademic Positions\nAssistant Professor, University of Illinois, 2021-Present\nOther Professional Employment\nVisiting Researcher at Google Research (N2Formal), Summer 2022 - Winter 2023\nResearch Scientist Intern at Amazon (Automated Reasoning Group), Summer 2016\nSoftware Development Engineer II at Amazon (Amazon Business), 2012 \u2013 2015\nProfessional Highlights\nProof repair, the subject of my PhD thesis, has since been reimplemented by researchers and engineers at Amazon and NASA, and adapted to the languages they use.

Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California at San Diego, 4 September 2000.\nM.S. in Fundamentals of Computing, University of Bucharest, Romania, 1996\nB.A. in Mathematics, University of Bucharest, Romania, 1995\nBiography\nGrigore Rosu does research in design, semantics and implementation of programming and specification languages, automated software engineering and formal methods, especially push-button techniques for certification, monitoring, synthesis and modularization, and in automated reasoning about computer systems, applications of logics, theorem proving, algorithms, (co)algebra, and category theory. He teaches classes on software engineering, programming languages, formal methods, and runtime verification. Before joining UIUC in 2002, he was a research scientist at NASA Ames. He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of California at San Diego in 2000 and his M.S. at the University of Bucharest, Romania, in 1996. Grigore was offered the CAREER award by the NSF in 2005, the outstanding junior award by the CS Department at UIUC in 2005, and the Dean's award for excellence in research by the College of Engineering at UIUC in 2014. He won the ASE IEEE/ACM most influential paper award in 2016 and the RV test of time award for papers published in 2001 that shaped the runtime verification field, and distinguished/best paper awards at ASE 2008, ASE 2016, OOPSLA 2016, ETAPS 2002. He was ranked a UIUC excellent teacher in Spring 2013, Fall 2012, Spring 2008 and Fall 2004.\nRosu is known for work in runtime verification, the K framework, matching logic, and automated coinduction.\nRuntime verification was coined by Havelund and Rosu as the name of a workshop they started in 2001, aimed at addressing problems at the boundary between formal verification and testing. Since 2001, runtime verification (RV) has grown into an active and diverse community, with its own international conference. The underlying idea of RV is to verify a system while it executes, where the system is either instrumented or simulated in an environment in which efficient monitors are generated from specifications and checked against the running system. Combined with recovery when properties are violated, RV can be used as a scalable alternative to formal verification, yielding the same correctness guarantees but at a cost fraction. Runtime verification has got significant traction in the formal verification and software engineering communities, where major conferences include special tracks named Runtime Verification. Within the RV field, Rosu and his collaborators introduced several notions, seminal algorithms and techniques for parametric property monitoring, efficient monitor synthesis, runtime predictive analysis, as well as monitoring-oriented programming as a programming paradigm where a formal specification and an implementation form together a (runtime verified) system. In 2010, Rosu founded the company Runtime Verification, Inc. , as a vehicle to productize and commercialize RV technology to customers such as NASA, Boeing, Toyota, Denso, as well as emerging companies in the blockchain space such as Ethereum Foundation, IOHK, Tezos, Algorand, Maker, Gnosis, etc.\nThe K framework was proposed by Rosu together with his FSL lab in 2003, as an executable semantic framework. Programming languages, type systems and formal analysis tools can be defined uniformly in the K framework, using configurations, computations and rewrite rules. The distinctive feature of K is that once a system is formalized as a K definition, all the tools needed for that system, from concrete execution engines (interpreters, virtual machines (VMs), compilers) to symbolic execution and formal verification tools, can and should be derived automatically or semi-automatically, correct-by-construction. The goal of K is to put an end to the adhoc language tool development. Several complete semantics of real-life programming languages, such as C, Java, JavaScript, Python, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine, have been formally defined in K.\nMatching logic is a unifying logic for programming languages, specification, and verification. Matching logic is as expressive as first-order logic (FOL) plus induction, but it provides a compact notation that captures, as syntactic sugar, several logics and formalisms of critical importance such as: algebraic specification and initial algebra semantics, FOL with least fixed points , typed or untyped lambda-calculi, dependent type systems, separation logic with recursive predicates, rewriting logic, Hoare logic, temporal logics, dynamic logic, modal \u03bc-calculus, and so on.\nRosu proposed circular coinduction in his PhD thesis, as an automation of coinduction in the context of hidden logic. This was further generalized into a principle that unifies and automates proofs by both induction and coinduction, and has been implemented or incorporated in provers such as Coq, Isabelle/HOL, and CIRC.\nOther Professional Employment\nPresident & CEO.

After his Ph.D., he was recruited by Arizona State University to help co-found (along with Thanassis Rikakis) the School of Arts, Media and Engineering (AME). AME is a transdisciplinary school that emphasizes scholarship and pedagogy with roots in the arts, design, and engineering. He served as Associate Director for AME (2009-12). He joined the University of Illinois in 2014 as an Associate Professor with a joint appointment between the departments of Computer Science and the Charles H. Sandage Department of Advertising. He received the Eliahu Jury award for best dissertation (2002), IBM faculty awards (2007, 2008), and several best-paper awards and best-paper runner-up honors from IEEE and ACM conferences. He was elected as ACM distinguished scientist in 2019 and IEEE senior member in 2019.\nSundaram's research spans applied machine learning, network science, and human-computer interaction. He develops algorithms and builds systems that help individuals to understand and to act. Constraining system and algorithm design to account for human cognition limits is a central thread in his research. Among his major contributions in Multimedia Computing include a feedback-control algorithm for a ground-breaking, real-time mixed-reality system for stroke patient rehabilitation, which aimed to help stroke survivors re-learn how to reach and grasp objects. Other major contributions within Network Science include algorithms for identifying homogenous communities within large heterogeneous networks, detecting collective behavior, and efficient sampling of large graphs.\nSundaram\u2019s current focus is motivated by the need to solve large-scale collective-action problems (e.g., public health; climate change). Collective-action problems require us to confront a fundamental tension: How do we reconcile an individual\u2019s desire for agency and choice in what they do with the greater common good? Computer Science can facilitate a scaling effect on theories of collective action. He develops algorithms for robust inference of behavior, including systemic bias, designs mechanisms to improve social-welfare, designs algorithms for synthesis of messages, and develops computational infrastructure to enable large-scale field experiments.\nResearch Areas\nData and Information Systems\nInteractive Computing\nRecent Courses Taught\nADV 490 - Computational Advertising\nCS 412 CSP (CS 412 ONL, CS 412 P3, CS 412 P4) - Introduction to Data Mining\nCS 469 (ADV 462) - Comp Adv Infrastructure\nCS 470 - Social and Information Network\nCS 498 CA3 (CS 498 CA4, CS 498 CAU, CS 498 HS1, CS 498 HS2, CS 498 HS3, CS 498 HS4) - Computational Advertising\nClick for more\nRelated News\nSeveral CS Students Earn Fellowships that Recognize Research Efforts\nIllinois CS Papers Earn Top Honors at Recent Conferences\nNSF RAPID Grant Examines Social Networks' Ability to Slow COVID-19 Spread\nIllinois CS Hosts First-Of-Its-Kind NSF Workshop on Departmental Plans for Broadening Participation in Computing\nAbdelzaher, Chan, Karahalios, and Sundaram Honored by ACM\nCRA Awards Recognize Four Illinois CS Undergrads For Research"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/rubyt", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nRuby Tahboub\nRuby Tahboub\nTeaching Assistant Professor\nrubyt@illinois.edu\nEducation\nPurdue University, West Lafayette, M.S in Computer Science -2016\nPurdue University, West Lafayette, Ph.D. in Computer Science - 2019\nAcademic Positions\nTeaching Assistant Professor, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Computer Science, 2022-Present.\nVisiting Assistant Professor, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Computer Science, 2019-2022\nTeaching Statement\nMy teaching philosophy focuses on helping students construct the link between abstract concepts and practice while minimizing the cognitive load. To that end, my teaching approach builds on the idea of opening, extending, and closing circles of communication, i.e., reciprocal discussions with students. For instance, when teaching a new topic, I approach the challenge as a series of circles of communication where each circle focuses on one solution stage. In my experience, I found the reciprocal nature of this approach lends itself to incremental learning that effectively links concepts and applications.\nRecent Courses Taught\nCS 101 - Intro Computing: Engrg & Sci\nCS 412 P3 (CS 412 P4, CS 412 PG, CS 412 PU) - Introduction to Data Mining\nRelated News\n12 New Faculty Add to Expertise in Research and Education at Illinois Computer Science"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/mjt", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nMatus Jan Telgarsky\nMatus Jan Telgarsky\nAssistant Professor\n(217) 300-4507\nmjt@illinois.edu\n3212 Siebel Center for Comp Sci\nFor More Information\nMatus Telgarsky's webpage\nResearch Areas\nArtificial Intelligence\nTheory and Algorithms\nRecent Courses Taught\nCS 446 (ECE 449) - Machine Learning\nCS 540 - Deep Learning Theory\nCS 598 DLT (CS 598 TEL) - Machine Learning Theory\nRelated News\nThree Illinois Computer Science Faculty Earn NSF CAREER Awards"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/miketiss", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nMichael Benjamin Tissenbaum\nMichael Benjamin Tissenbaum\nAssistant Professor\nmiketiss@illinois.edu\nRecent Courses Taught\nCI 435 - Tech Applications for Teachers\nCI 438 - Comp Prgrmmg and the Classroom\nCI 482 - Social Learning and Multimedia\nCI 489 - Ed Tech Capstone Course\nCI 499 - Technology Apps for Teachers\nClick for more\nRelated News"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/htong", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nHanghang Tong\nHanghang Tong\nAssociate Professor\n(217) 244-0884\nhtong@illinois.edu\n2120 Siebel Center for Comp Sci\nFor More Information\nHanghang Tong's homepage.\nHanghang Tong's Google Scholar.\nResearch Interests\nLarge scale data mining and machine learning, especially for graph and multimedia data with applications to social networks analysis, healthcare, cyber-security and e-commerce.\nResearch Areas\nArtificial Intelligence\nData and Information Systems\nRecent Courses Taught\nCS 412 CSP (CS 412 ONL, CS 412 P3, CS 412 P4) - Introduction to Data Mining\nCS 512 - Data Mining Principles\nCS 514 - Adv Topics in Network Science\nCS 598 HT - Network Mining\nRelated News\nCS Team Awarded $5M NSF Grant to Take on Large Graph Problems\nTong's Amazon Research Award Explores Streaming Recommendation Prompts\nTen-Year Highest Impact Paper Award Acknowledges Tong\u2019s Work in Graph Alignment, Confirms Career Choices\nThree Honorees Find Inspiration, Validation from David J.

Zhao and Heather Zheng), and a B.E. from Tsinghua University in 2010. After working as an Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech (2016 - 2019), he joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019. Currently, he is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and also has affiliate faculty appointments in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and the Informatics Program of the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2018), Amazon Research Award (2021), Google Faculty Research Award (2017), and Best Paper Awards from IMWUT 2019, ACM CCS 2018, and SIGMETRICS 2013. His projects have been covered by media outlets such as MIT Technology Review, The New York Times, Boston Globe, CNN, and ACM TechNews.\nGang Wang's research interests are Security and Privacy, Internet Measurement, and Data Mining. His work takes a data-driven approach to addressing emerging security threats in massive communication systems (social media, email services), crowdsourcing systems, mobile applications, and enterprise networks. His major contribution is a series of measurement methodologies that have revealed previously overlooked security threats, including crowdturfing activities in online social networks, security certification failures in the payment card industry, email spoofing vulnerabilities in major email providers, and the deep link usage in mobile app ecosystems. Another key contribution is his work on applying machine learning in security applications (e.g., bot detection, malware classification) to handle adversarial behaviors and concept drift.\nGang Wang's current focus is on developing robust data-driven methods (e.g., machine learning models, graph models) to enable accurate, scalable, and user-friendly security applications for malware analysis and online abuse mitigation. The key challenge Wang is tackling is to effectively engineer human-machine collaboration pipelines to improve the efficacy and efficiency of both parties against adaptive attackers in the respective fields. Wang is currently collaborating with industry partners and researchers from related fields such as HCI and AI to address these problems.\nAcademic Positions\nAssociate Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, Aug. 2023 - Present\nAffiliate Faculty, Informatics Programs, School of Information Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, Sep. 2021 - Present\nAffiliate Faculty, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, Nov. 2020 - Present\nAssistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, Aug. 2019 - Aug. 2023\nResearch Areas\nSecurity and Privacy\nSystems and Networking\nSelected Articles in Journals\nHuandong Wang, Yong Li, Gang Wang, and Depeng Jin. \u201dLinking Multiple User Identities of Multiple Services from Massive Mobility Traces.\u201d In ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 2021.\nHuan Yan, Tzu-Heng Lin, Gang Wang, Yong Li, Haitao Zheng, Depeng Jin, and Ben Y.

In healthcare, that means patient outcomes (e.g., patient safety, quality of care) as well as clinician outcomes (e.g., workload, burnout). She has conducted research focused on primary care, care coordination of patients with chronic conditions (hospital to community care transitions) and trauma care. Her dissertation, conducted in the context of a larger project developing health information technology to support teamwork and care transitions, took a macroergonomic approach to studying care transitions of trauma patients. She then examined on the handoff communication associated with those handoffs as instances of team cognition.\nCurrent projects include continuing to study care transitions; she plans to conduct observation studies of inpatient care transitions between hospital units as well as return to the community care setting by studying hospital discharge care transitions. Part of this work will explore the concept of the \u201cpatient journey,\u201d i.e., spatio-temporal distribution of patients\u2019 interactions with multiple care settings (e.g., hospitals, clinics, home, long-term care, etc.) over time. She plans to develop interventions, such as redesigned processes, new technologies, etc., to improve care transitions; this will involve participatory design processes and usability evaluations in her lab and/or simulated settings such as JUMP Simulation. A third area of research includes developing ways to measure team cognition, particular in care transitions. Key components of her research approach include engaging frontline workers (patients and their family as well as various healthcare professionals) and utilizing mixed methods, i.e., both qualitative and quantitative, research designs.\nCheck out the Human Factors in Sociotechnical Systems Laboratory, directed by Dr. Wooldridge, website at https://hfss.ise.illinois.edu/contact-us/\nGraduate Research Opportunities\nHuman factors is a diverse field, and much of the work we do requires knowledge from multiple disciplines.
