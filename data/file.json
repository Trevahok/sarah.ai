In the last few years, co-developed two new interdisciplinary courses with colleagues from other departments: (1) \"Visualizing and Navigating Knowledge Networks.\" Co-developed with Profs. N. Contractor of Dept. of Speech Communication and Prof. M. Twidale of School of Library and Information Science. Under Madden Grant, awarded by UIUC Chancellor's office. Taught twice. (2) \"Image Structure, Content and Depiction.\" Co-developed with Prof. P. Dhillon of Dept. of Educational Policy Studies. Being taught in Spring 2008.\nResearch Statement\n(1) Introduced a new computational approach to automatically extracting syntax of images, and using it for automated image understanding. We introduced automated ways of discovering, modeling, recognizing and explaining object categories occurring in arbitrary image sets without supervision and automatically organizing these categories into taxonomies. (2) Introduced a novel, Fourier based formulation for representation and synthesis of videos of dynamic textures. Conventionally, dynamic textures have been analyzed only in spatial domain.\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities\nUndergraduate student can participate in research projects in the areas of computer vision, pattern recognition, human computer interaction, novel cameras and image and video retrieval.\nResearch Interests\nComputer Vision, Robotics, Image Processing, Sensors, Pattern Recognition, Virtual Environments, Intelligent Interfaces\nResearch Areas\nInteractive Computing\nProgramming Languages / Formal Methods / Software Engineering\nHonors\nBest Paper Award from IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 2006\nAssociate in the Center for Advanced Study, 2005-06\nOn Incomplete List of Teachers Ranked Excellent by Their Students, 2002\n1999 UIUC Campus Award for Guiding Undergraduate Research - Honorable-Mention\n1999 Donald Biggar Willet Professorship of UIUC College of Engineering\n1999 Emanuel R.
