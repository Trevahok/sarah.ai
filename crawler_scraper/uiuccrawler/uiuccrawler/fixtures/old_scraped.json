Amato she/her/hers\nAbel Bliss Professor of Engineering and Department Head\n(217) 333-3426\nnamato@illinois.edu\n2248 Siebel Center for Comp Sci\nFor More Information\nNancy Amato's CV\nParasol Lab\nBiography\nNancy M. Amato is Head of the Computer Science Department and Abel Bliss Professor of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She received undergraduate degrees in Mathematical Sciences and Economics from Stanford, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois, respectively. Before returning to her alma mater in 2019, she was Unocal Professor and Regents Professor at Texas A&M University and Senior Director of Engineering Honors Programs.\nResearch and student mentoring. Amato is known for algorithmic contributions to robotics task and motion planning, computational biology and geometry, and parallel and distributed computing. She has graduated 25 PhD students, with most going to faculty positions (12) or research positions in government or industry (9), and has worked with 30+ master's students, 100+ undergraduate researchers, and 10+ high school students. A majority of her students are from groups underrepresented in computing. Her group has developed several groundbreaking approaches for biasing sampling that have enabled sampling-based motion planning, the dominant approach in use today in robotics, to be applied in areas where it was not feasible before. She and her students were the first to use these methods to study protein motion and folding. She is also known for her work in computational geometry, including the development of approximate convex decomposition (ACD) for partitioning polyhedra, and parallel algorithms, including novel approaches for parallel graph traversals.\nAmato's current research focus for robotics is exploring task planning and interaction in dynamic multi-robot systems, including collaboration with other robots and humans. In computational biology, she is interested studying protein-drug interaction and binding site accessibility. For all these, she is investigating methods that incorporate learning at various levels and leverage workspace topology. In parallel and distributed computing, she is continuing her longstanding collaboration with Lawrence Rauchwerger on the STAPL (Standard Templates Adaptive Parallel Library) project with a particular interest on approximate parallel algorithms for large and dynamic graphs.  She is also co-leading an exciting new multi-disciplinary and multi-university NSF Expeditions in Computing project \u2013 Mind in Vitro \u2013 that is seeking to build a computing system based on living biological neurons.\nLeadership roles and broadening participation in computing. Amato has served in numerous leadership roles including CRA Board Chair (2021-2025), AAAS Section-T Chair (2021-2022), ACM Council Member-at-Large (2020-2024), and IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Vice President (2018-2021). She is passionate about broadening participation in computing and has worked at the international, national and local level. She has served as CRA-WP Co-Chair (2014-2017) and as NCWIT Academic Alliance Co-Chair (2009-2011). She has Co-Directed the CRA-WP Distributed REU (DREU) program since 2000; DREU is a national program that matches students from groups underrepresented in computing, including women, ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities, with a faculty mentor for a summer research experience at the faculty member's home institution. She was Program Chair for the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) which featured an all-female organizing committee and 50% female invited speakers.\nRecognition. Amato's honors include the 2019 IEEE RAS Saridis Leadership Award in Robotics and Automation, the inaugural NCWIT Harrold and Notkin Research and Graduate Mentoring Award in 2014, the inaugural NCWIT Harrold and Notkin Research and Graduate Mentoring Award in 2014, the A. Nico Habermann Award from the CRA in 2014 for her contributions to increasing diversity in computing, and the 2013 IEEE Education Society Hewlett-Packard/Harriet B. Rigas Award. She received Texas A&M university-level awards in research (2018) and teaching (2011), and the Betty M. Unterberger Award for Outstanding Service to Honors Education at Texas A&M in 2013. She received a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation, and was an AT&T Bell Laboratories PhD Scholar. Amato is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).\nResearch Interests\nParallel and distributed computing, parallel algorithms, performance modeling and optimization.\nMotion planning, robotics, computational biology, computational geometry, animation, CAD.\nResearch Areas\nArchitecture, Compilers, and Parallel Computing\nArtificial Intelligence\nBioinformatics and Computational Biology\nScientific Computing\nTheory and Algorithms\nRecent Courses Taught\nCS 199 STR - CS Stars Seminar\nCS 491 PD (CS 491 PDO) - Professional Development\nCS 591 CS (CS 591 CSO, CS 591 PHD) - PHD Orientation Seminar\nRelated News\nIllinois Computer Science Rankings On the Rise for Graduate Specialty Programs\nNew Tuition Grant for Undergraduate CS Majors in 2024-25\n'Brain Train': Why a Billion-dollar Rail Improvement Project Could be a 'Game-changer' for Chicago Startups\n2023 Celebration of Excellence Highlights Powerful Illinois CS Community\nAmato Joins University Leaders to Officially Launch New MCS in Chicago Program\nGallegos Seeks to Connect, Empower Similar Students Through the Student-Run B[U]ILT"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/vadve", "data": "HomeAboutPeopleAll Faculty\nVikram Adve\nVikram Adve\nDonald B.

Can I enter that date on my application?\nYou can report future test dates on your application so that the admissions committee will see that you will be taking the exam. Please keep in mind that decisions regarding financial assistance will not be made until test scores are received. If official scores are not reported by the application deadlines, you run the risk of your application not being reviewed.\nI do not have a passing Speak score in TOEFL or IELTS. Am I eligible for financial assistance?\nIf the admissions committee decides to admit you and you do not have a passing \u201cspeaking\u201d score, you may be considered for financial assistance. However, these opportunities will be restricted by your qualifications and other available funding.\nI ordered my TOEFL (IELTS) scores to be submitted to the university. When would the exam scores show as received?\nIt can take more than four weeks from the time you order the scores to be received at the university and matched up with your application. Due to the high volume of application material processed, we are unable to check on the status of scores being submitted.  You may upload a scanned PDF copy of the full official score report to your application as \"supplemental material\" until official scores are received.\nMy TOEFL (IELTS) scores were submitted to the university before I submitted my graduate application.

He attended University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1986 to 1990, where he received both his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science. While in graduate school, he held internships at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, followed by positions at Cadence Design Systems and TCSI Corporation post-graduation. At the time of his untimely death at the age of 37, he was a Software Architect at Evolve Corporation, a start-up in San Francisco, CA. His areas of expertise were computer-aided design for VLSI, simulation, testing, parallel processing, formal design verification, as well as object oriented analysis and design, and pattern languages.\nRobert was a remarkable human being: a gentle spirit with an insatiable intellectual curiosity and zest for life. Aside from being a researcher and computer scientist, he was a musician, an athlete, and a writer. He had a passion for thinking, ideas, and learning, as well as for living life through friendship, music, food, and travel. Even as he battled cancer, he never lost his optimism, sense of humor, and vitality. In the words of Paul Chen (PhD EE '93), a close friend: \"Robert was known by his Illini friends as The Uberman, partly because of his German ethnicity, and partly because he was an amazing individual\u2014someone whom we respected and admired for his ability to achieve excellence in all that he did. He had a passion for living. And he excelled in life: the Uberman could out-almost-anything us, all the while smiling effortlessly and encouragingly at us lesser mortals.\"\nRobert thrived and made life-long friends at Illinois and it is hoped that the Mueller-Thuns Lectureship in Computer Science will give the chance to others at Illinois to think more, learn more, and do more as an appropriate memorial to a man whose intellectual intensity, integrity, and vibrancy made him an inspiration to all who knew him.\nMueller-Thuns Lecturers\nTitle Date Speaker\nFrom Robots to Biomolecules: Computing in the Physical World November 18, 2019 Lydia E.

Gillies Memorial Lecture\nEquity & Justice in Computing Lectures\nRobert Mueller-Thuns Lecture\nThe Donald B. Gillies Memorial Lectureship in Computer Science was established at the University of Illinois through memorial gifts by family and friends, with a major contribution by the Digital Equipment Corporation.\nProfessor Gillies, a native of Canada, did his undergraduate work at the University of Toronto, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1953. While in graduate school he worked as a graduate assistant at the Institute for Advanced Study with John von Neumann in the fields of game theory and computer science. Before coming to the University of Illinois in 1956, he spent two years with the National Research Development Corporation at Cambridge University and London, England. He was among the first mathematicians to become involved in the computer field, helping to calculate the first Sputnik orbit and later discovering three new prime numbers in the course of checking out ILLIAC II. (For nearly a decade, the latter was commemorated by the Mathematics Department with a postage mark stamped on all outgoing mail.) Before his death in 1975, he was experimenting with educational uses and networking possibilities of minicomputers.\nDonald Gillies\nAlthough a lifelong stutter affected his class lectures, Gillies was an inspiration to his students, taking an interest in both their professional and personal lives. Long before timesharing terminals, minicomputers and microprocessors made \u201chands on\u201d computer experience commonplace, he recognized the need for students to have this opportunity and implemented a system to provide it. For example, during a family vacation to Canada, he picked up a newly developed Fortran compiler from the University of Waterloo so it could be implemented at Illinois, his son Don (MS CS '90, PhD CS '93) recalled. With its quick turnaround capabilities, this compiler enabled the university to offer programming classes to non-CS students for the first time. \nThroughout his work and teaching he stressed the importance of the ethical use of computing machines in contemporary science. Dedicated to the honest uses of technology, environmentally concerned, a man of wit, vigor and understanding, he challenged and stimulated all who knew him.\nIt is hoped that the Donald B. Gillies Lectureship in Computer Science will continue to enrich the lives of students and colleagues as an appropriate memorial to a man whose intellectual excellence and moral purpose made him a distinguished teacher and scientist.\nPast Lecturers\nSystems Research - Construed Broadly Dec. 3, 2019 Margo I.

Gillies Memorial Lecture\nEquity & Justice in Computing Lectures\nRobert Mueller-Thuns Lecture\nThe Utpal Banerjee Distinguished Lecture Series in High Performance Computing\nAn adjunct professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, Utpal Banerjee spent nearly 20 years of his career at Intel in the Software Solutions Group, where he developed techniques to enhance the performance of multi-core processors.\nUtpal Banerjee\nIn the early days of parallel computing while working as a graduate student for Illinois CS Professor David Kuck, Banerjee developed a strategy for automatically analyzing a loop and determining whether it could be executed in parallel. His method, later dubbed Banerjee\u2019s test, was a simple, fast, and effective data dependence test that has been widely used for compiler development and has had a big impact on advancing compiler technology.\nWhile at Intel, he developed a formal representation and generalization of loop transformation techniques. By formalizing the transformation of code, Banerjee created the foundations of modern work on program restructuring, which is now known as the polyhedron model. In the 1990s, he wrote several books on loop dependence and transformations for restructuring compilers. Banerjee is a fellow of ACM and IEEE.\nWhen Utpal Banerjee died in 2017, members of his family said they were only beginning to understand the impact the Illinois Computer Science alumnus had on high performance computing. As a result, his daughter, Sanchita Banerjee Saxena, and her family have established the Utpal Banerjee Distinguished Lecture Series in High Performance Computing. Through their gift they are able to both honor his memory and provide a platform for the department to showcase one of the areas in which it excels, and to remember one of its own in a lasting way.\nBanerjee Lecturers\nTitle Date Speaker\nOptimizing a Computation April 14, 2022 David J.

Interactive computing studies how computers and people can cooperate effectively on any number of tasks.\nOur work targets problems in social computing, design and creativity, decision making, intelligent systems, and cognitive modeling. For example, we study the transparency of algorithms controlling social media feeds, the use of robotics in domestic environments to support aging in place, and the application of crowdsourcing for creative work. Working at times with companies like Adobe, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, NVidia, and Tableau, our research synthesizes knowledge from machine learning, psychology, design, and the learning sciences to study and address important problems in society. We also work on the presentation of and interaction with information, ranging from dashboards of visualizations to VR displays of photorealistic video games.\nStrengths and Impact\nThe interactive computing area comprises scholars with diverse preparation, methodologies, and perspectives spanning interaction design, visualization, applied machine learning, decision sciences, and social computing. These scholars share the common goal of designing computational artifacts and developing pedagogy to address important questions that arise when algorithms mediate (and influence) individual and group decision-making; team formation or collectives; interaction design; and mechanisms that influence online behavioral norms. The group\u2019s intellectual diversity is critical to address these questions, provides group synergies, and facilitates meaningful collaboration with scholars across other units across campus.\nGroundbreaking Research\nAwards\nPublic Engagement\nResearch Efforts and Groups\nCenter for People and Infrastructure in the Coordinated Science Laboratory\nComputer Graphics Illinois\nIllinois HCI\n  Seminars\nThe HCI seminar brings in emerging and established intellectual leaders in the field of human-computer interaction to present their latest research findings and visions.

We assume and expect that you will behave ethically, honestly, and with the highest degree of integrity befitting a scholar. You are expected to adopt the following Code of Honor to demonstrate your commitment to these principles:\nAs a member of the University of Illinois academic community, I pledge to conduct myself in accordance with the highest standards of academic integrity.\nWhat does this mean? In order to better understand your responsibilities, you should read the rest of this document, which outlines university and CS department policies.\nWhat is Cheating?\nThe University's Student Code, with which all students are expected to be familiar, describes in detail many types of breaches of academic integrity, including cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication, among others. Read Section 1-402 of the Student Code now! Here, we use the term \"cheating\" to mean any of the types of infractions described in the code. You should also become familiar with the Provost\u2019s Quick Reference Guide to Academic Integrity.\nThere are no good reasons to cheat, but there are many reasons not to. Cheating devalues your own degree, and that of others. It is unfair to other students in the class. Often, it sacrifices your own long-term educational goals for perceived short-term gains. You stand a high likelihood of being caught, and receiving a lower grade (perhaps a failing one) in the course. CS students have been expelled from the university for cheating.\nActing Ethically\nActing ethically goes beyond simply \"not cheating\". For example, it is ethical, and important, to report students who you suspect have cheated to your professors - as failure to do so may result in honest students receiving lower grades (in a course that grades on a curve). You are urged to read the ACM Code of Ethics for a more complete description of the high standards set by CS professionals. \nWhat is allowed in CS courses?\nThe university definitions that you've read apply to CS classes, and clearly cover infractions such as copying on exams or written assignments.  For programming assignments, as with most assignments, it is usually fine to discuss the concepts with your classmates (but check the course policy).  A typical course policy might be that when it comes to designing or writing the program (even just the 'pseudo-code'), you must do it yourself, unless the instructor has said otherwise.  \nCertainly, if you are copying text directly from someone else - whether copying files or typing from someone else's notes or typing while they dictate - then you are cheating (committing plagiarism, to be more exact). This is true regardless of whether the source is a classmate, a former student, a website, a program listing found in the trash, or whatever.  And, plagiarism even on a small part of the program is not allowed, nor is starting out with code that you did not write and modifying it to look like your own.\nAs described in the Student Code, aiding someone else's cheating also constitutes cheating. Leaving your program in plain sight or leaving a computer without logging out, thereby leaving your programs open to copying, may constitute cheating depending upon the circumstances. Consequently, you should always take care to prevent others from copying your programs, as it certainly leaves you open to accusations of cheating. If somebody else hands in code identical to yours, you may be penalized!\nFinally, anything written here should not be taken to supercede the particular policies applied by individual professors. It is your responsibility to determine exactly what type of interaction with other people may be allowed, what resources may be consulted, etc., in each of your CS classes. If the course web page does not list a policy, you should ask your instructor to publicize one.\nSanctions\nCheating in Computer Science classes is a serious problem, as it devalues the hard work of honest students. Therefore, the department is determined to eliminate it by making the chances of getting caught high enough, and the sanctions severe enough, that any student considering cheating will choose instead to just do their best, honestly, even if it means a low grade.\nOn our campus, professors have very wide discretion in determining what constitutes cheating in their classes and what sanctions will be applied. However, the department has adopted the following guidelines. Professors are encouraged to apply sanctions at least as severe as these if the facts warrant. You should be sure you understand the particular course policy. (Some course web pages may simply link to this page for the course cheating policy.)\nRecommended sanctions for cheating in a CS course\nFirst offense for cheating:\non an exam: zero on the exam\non a programming assignment, quiz, or written homework: zero on the assignment and final course grade is lowered by one whole letter grade.\nMultiple instances of cheating of any kind: failure in the course.\nOther penalties\nAs noted above, an instructor has wide flexibility in imposing sanctions, and may be either more strict or more lenient than this. Note that all cases in which a student has been found to have committed an infraction of academic integrity are reported to the CS department, to the student's college, and to the Senate Committee on Student Discipline.\nDepartmental penalties.\nIf a student is found cheating in different courses, in the same course in different semesters, or in particularly egregious cases, the department will consider the case for possible additional penalties including suspension or dismissal from the university. Similarly, the college, or university may take action beyond the instructor's penalty, including suspension or dismissal.\nProcedures\nThe procedures to be followed by instructor and student in cases of \"infractions of academic integrity\" are laid out in the Campus Code. It is somewhat dense reading, but the basics are these (refer to the link above for the definitive version):\nUsing the Faculty Academic Integrity Reporting portal (\"FAIR\") at my.cs.illinois.edu/fair, the instructor sends a message informing the student that s/he is being accused of cheating.\nThe student has ten business days to respond, also using the FAIR portal. Failure to respond within the ten days will be taken as an admission of the maximum level of culpability.\nAfter considering the student's response, the instructor will make a timely decision in the case, and if he or she still believes there has been an infraction, will impose a sanction via the FAIR portal.\nIf the instructor finds that the student has committed an infraction, then the student has the right to appeal the decision within five business days, by contacting the director of undergraduate programs (currently egunter@cs.illinois.edu). In some cases, the situation can be negotiated and resolved without a hearing, but most appeals are heard by a departmental committee.\nIt is important to use the FAIR portal, because it tracks the deadlines, notifies the students of their rights in the process, and notifies the appropriate administrative offices of a pending or completed case. However, many instructors and students find it helpful to discuss the issues directly with each other, and this \"off-portal\" communication is fine, perhaps encouraged, but ultimately the FAIR portal must be used, even if to simply summarize what the student and instructor have discussed."}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses", "data": "HomeAcademicsCourses\nCourses\nSpring 2023\nSummer 2023\nFall 2023\nAll\nNumber Title Prerequisites\nCS 101 Intro Computing: Engrg & Sci Credit in MATH 220 or MATH 221\nCS 102 Little Bits to Big Ideas\nCS 105 Intro Computing: Non-Tech\nCS 107 Data Science Discovery\nCS 124 Intro to Computer Science I\nCS 128 Intro to Computer Science II Credit in CS 124\nCS 173 Discrete Structures Credit in MATH 220 or MATH 221\nCredit in CS 124 or CS 125 or ECE 220\nCS 199 CA Training\nCS 210 Ethical & Professional Issues Credit in CS 225\nCS 211 Ethical & Professional Conduct\nCS 222 Software Design Lab Credit in CS 128\nCredit or concurrent registration in CS 225\nCS 225 Data Structures Credit in CS 173 or MATH 213 or MATH 347 or MATH 412 or MATH 413\nCredit in CS 125 or CS 128 or ECE 220\nCS 233 Computer Architecture Credit in CS 125 or CS 128\nCredit in CS 173 or MATH 213\nCredit or concurrent registration in CS 225\nCS 277 Algo & Data Stru for Data Sci\nCS 340 Intro to Computer Systems Credit in CS 225\nCS 357 Numerical Methods I Credit in CS 101 or CS 105 or CS 124 or CS 125 or ECE 220\nCredit in ASRM 406 or MATH 225 or MATH 257 or MATH 415 or MATH 416\nCredit in MATH 241\nCS 361 Prob & Stat for Computer Sci Credit in MATH 220 or MATH 221\nCredit or concurrent registration in ASRM 406 or MATH 225 or MATH 257 or MATH 415 or MATH 416\nCS 374 Intro to Algs & Models of Comp Credit in CS 173 or CS 225 or MATH 213\nCS 402 Accel Fund of Computing II\nCS 403 Accel Fund of Algorithms II\nCS 411 Database Systems Credit in CS 225\nCS 412 Introduction to Data Mining\nCS 413 Intro to Combinatorics\nCS 415 Game Development\nCS 418 Interactive Computer Graphics\nCS 420 Parallel Progrmg: Sci & Engrg\nCS 421 Progrmg Languages & Compilers Credit in CS 233 or CS 240 or CS 340\nCredit in CS 374 or ECE 374\nCredit in ASRM 406 or MATH 225 or MATH 257 or MATH 415 or MATH 416\nCS 425 Distributed Systems\nCS 431 Embedded Systems\nCS 433 Computer System Organization\nCS 434 Mobile Computing & Application\nCS 437 Topics in Internet of Things\nCS 438 Communication Networks\nCS 440 Artificial Intelligence\nCS 441 Applied Machine Learning Credit in CS 225\nCredit in CS 361\nCS 442 Trustworthy Machine Learning\nCS 443 Reinforcement Learning\nCS 444 Deep Learning for Compt Visn\nCS 445 Computational Photography\nCS 446 Machine Learning Credit in CS 225\nCredit or concurrent registration in Arms 406 or bioe 210 or Math 225 or Math 257 or Math 415 or Math 416\nCredit or concurrent registration in CS 361 or Ece 313 or Math 461 or stat 400\nCS 447 Natural Language Processing\nCS 448 Audio Computing Laboratory Credit or concurrent registration in CS 241 or Credit in CS 341 or Credit or concurrent registration in ECE 391\nCredit or concurrent registration in ARMS 406 or BIOE 210 or Credit in MATH 257 or Credit or concurrent registration in MATH 415 or MATH 416\nCS 450 Numerical Analysis Credit in CS 101 or CS 125\nCredit in CS 357 or MATH 415\nCredit in MATH 285\nCS 461 Computer Security I\nCS 463 Computer Security II\nCS 464 Topics in Societal Impacts\nCS 468 Tech and Advertising Campaigns\nCS 473 Algorithms\nCS 474 Logic in Computer Science\nCS 475 Formal Models of Computation\nCS 477 Formal Software Devel Methods\nCS 483 Applied Parallel Programming\nCS 491 CAP Adv Competitive Algorithm Prog\nCS 491 CB IAT Seminar\nCS 491 EIC Excursions in computing II\nCS 493 Senior Project II, ACP\nCS 494 Senior Project II\nCS 498 DSO Cloud Computing Applications\nCS 498 MP3 Intro to Machine Perception\nCS 500 Topics in Comp Ed Rsrch\nCS 508 Manycore Parallel Algorithms\nCS 510 Advanced Information Retrieval\nCS 523 Advanced Operating Systems\nCS 524 Concurrent Progrmg Languages\nCS 525 Advanced Distributed Systems\nCS 526 Advanced Compiler Construction\nCS 527 Topics in Software Engineering\nCS 533 Parallel Computer Architecture\nCS 534 Adv Topics in Comp Arch\nCS 538 Advanced Computer Networks\nCS 543 Computer Vision\nCS 555 Numerical Methods for PDEs\nCS 565 Human-Computer Interaction\nCS 588 Autonomous Vehicle System Eng\nCS 591 ACT Advanced Compiler Technology\nCS 591 IG ADV Sem in Distributed Systems\nCS 591 SE Advanced Seminar\nCS 591 SN Systems and Networking Seminar\nCS 591 TA Teaching Assistant Training\nCS 598 BAN Deep Generative & Dyn.

In addition, we recommend that you choose a CS 598 Special Topics course with a professor that you might want to secure as your thesis advisor. Graduate students are free to register for any 400 or 500-level course. If there is a pre-requisite for a course, it is your responsibility to ensure you have the prior knowledge required for the course. In addition, 400-level courses are introductory graduate level courses and can be taken for either 3 or 4 credits. If you select the 4 credit hour 400-level course, the faculty will usually have you do a project or paper for the extra credit hour.  During the early registration period, graduate students must register for the 4 credit section of the 400-level courses.  If you wish to take a 400-level course only for 3 credits, you may change the credits after the 10th day of the term.

This site is designed to give you guidance on registering for your first courses. You are in a professional, non-thesis, self-funded master's program. There is no research in this master's degree. Graduate Advisors can be reached at academic@cs.illinois.edu or on the CS Graduate Advising Queue.\nPlease review the Professional MCS Planning Document to help guide you on the program requirements.\nInformation about your first-semester enrollment procedures will be included in your Notice of Admission.\nWith increased enrollments in the CS department and on campus, CS courses tend to fill up quickly. We request that all new students follow the directions and register for their first semester as soon as registration is available to them.\nInternational Students\nInternational students must check-in at the International Student and Scholar Services Office (ISSS). Check-in details and schedules are available on the ISSS website.  International students must arrive on campus by the start date listed on your I-20 or DS-2019.\nRegistration\nRegistration for Fall 2023 courses opened on April, 20, 2023. We highly recommend that you register as soon as possible after this date. With increased enrollments in the CS department and on campus, CS courses tend to fill up quickly so we request that you register as soon as it is possible to do so.\nSteps to Complete for Course Registration\nTo start the registration process, you must first setup your NetID and password. The instructions for this were given to you in your \"official offer letter\" from the Graduate College. If you missed the link, please go to http://www.grad.illinois.edu/quick-guide.\nGo to https://registrar.illinois.edu/registration/registration-process/ to sign up for classes. To review the courses that will be offered in computer science, please visit the Course Explorer.\nCourses at the 400- and 500-level carry graduate credit.\nNumber of Minimum Credit Hours\nAll Professional MCS students in the on-campus program are required to register for at least 12 credit hours per semester toward the degree requirements in their first two (regular) semesters. On-campus MCS students have up to 3 continuous semesters to complete the degree requirements.  In the third semester, students are only required to take any remaining course credits necessary to complete their degree requirements.\nMCS students who hold a Teaching Assistantship or a Research Assistantship in their final term are required to register for at least 9 credit hours. Students in the Grainger College of Engineering on-campus graduate programs must register for at least 9 credit hours  to be considered full-time students.\nSelecting Courses\nFor your first semester, we recommend that you select courses that interest you and start to complete the \"Breadth Requirement\". In addition, we recommend that you do a mix of 400 and 500 level courses. Graduate students are free to register for any 400 or 500-level course. If there is a pre-requisite for a course, it is your responsibility to ensure you have the prior knowledge required for the course. In addition, 400-level courses are introductory graduate level courses and can be taken for either 3 or 4 credits. If you select the 4 credit hour 400-level course, the faculty will usually have you do a project or paper for the extra credit hour.  During the early registration period, graduate students must register for the 4 credit section of the 400-level courses.  If you wish to take a 400-level course only for 3 credits, you may change the credits after the 10th day of the term.  All 500-level courses are taken for 4 credit hours.\nGraduate Academic Office Contact Information\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE\nGraduate Academic Office\nUniversity of Illinois\n201 North Goodwin, 1312 Siebel Center\nUrbana, IL 61801\n\nCampus Mail Code: MC-258\nPhone: (217) 333-4428\nFax: (217) 244-6073\nEmail: academic@cs.illinois.edu\nOFFICE HOURS\nMonday \u2013 Friday\nMorning: 8:00 AM to 11:45 AM\nAfternoon: 1:00 PM to 4:45 PM\nWalk-in advising hours start at 10:00 AM\nList of Graduate Advising Contacts and Virtual Advising Queue"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-forms-advising-resources/graduate-student-annual-evaluation-process", "data": "HomeAcademicsGraduate AcademicsGraduate Forms & Advising ...Graduate Student Annual Evalua...\nGraduate Student Annual Evaluation Process\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nGraduate Academics\nPhD Program\nMS Program\nMS in Bioinformatics Program\nProfessional Master of Computer Science\nFifth Year Master's Programs\nIllinois Computing Accelerator for Non-Specialists (iCAN)\nGraduate Forms & Advising Resources\nEPI Exam Requirements\nGraduate Advising Contacts\nGraduate Student Annual Evaluation Process\nNew Graduate Student Resources\nOfficial Forms\nCourses\nHonor Code\nStudent Resources\nAll graduate students in the research-based programs, including students planning to graduate in the Spring or Summer semester of the current academic year, must complete the annual self-evaluation.

Therefore, please save the original form.)\nThree letters of reference, including a letter from your thesis advisor\nResume\nStatement of purpose\nThe application fee must be paid by the application deadline for the application to be considered complete.\nNote: Current international undergraduate students do not need to submit TOEFL/IELTS scores for admissions.  However, scores would be required to be eligible for Teaching Assistantship appointments.\nAcceptance into the Program\nAdmission decisions will be released by October 7th.\nStudents provisionally admitted to the program:\nAre assigned a graduate academic advisor.\nMust maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 through completion of the B.S. component of the program to remain in the program.\nIf they have 12 hours or less to complete in the FINAL semester of their undergraduate studies, they may register for four-credit graduate courses with approval from their graduate academic advisor. Please note that students cannot transfer more than 12 credit hours of coursework to their M.S. degree, including the shared coursework.\nMust earn at least 120 hours of undergraduate credit and 9 hours of graduate credit (this is the \"Breadth Requirement\" of the M.S. degree) and satisfy all B.S. requirements to be officially recommended for admission to the Graduate College.\nUpon successful completion of the B.S. component (including grades of B- or better in the \"Breadth Requirement\" coursework) and an overall GPA of at least 3.0 GPA, students\nWill be officially admitted into the Graduate College for the next term (not including the Summer term).\nWill be issued a letter of admission from the Graduate College Admission Office and the Department of Computer Science, at which time they will be considered graduate students and assessed for graduate tuition the following semester. International students may be required to submit additional documentation at this time.\nMay apply or be considered for graduate research or teaching assistantships, tuition waivers, fellowships, and scholarships available to graduate students.\nTo remain in the combined program, you must maintain a graduate GPA of 3.0 or better.\nMust complete all the remaining M.S. degree requirements within one academic year (spring-summer-fall or fall-spring-summer). Please note that if you finish your B.S. requirements in less than four years, you will not be given extra time to complete the M.S. degree requirements. You will finish this joint program in less than 5 years and be able to start working sooner!\nStudents in the program are eligible to apply for the Ph.D. program (fall entry only) in Computer Science near completion of the M.S. component. If admitted, the combined degree will count as Stage 1 of the Ph.D. program, as if the student is admitted with a Masters degree.\nCoursework\nBS-MS Degree Program Requirement Planning Form\nB.S. Component: 120 hours plus 3 \"Breadth Requirement\" courses for 9-12 graduate hours\nThe same required courses as the traditional B.S. degree, with the minimum hours required reduced to 120 hours.\nMust complete 3 \"Breadth Requirement\" courses: three different courses, each from a different area, from the following eight core areas with a grade of B- or higher.\nUniversity undergraduate student minimum residence requirement satisfied.\nOverall GPA of 3.0 or higher maintained through the completion of the B.S. component of the program.\nM.S. Component: Minimum 16-19 additional coursework hours plus 4 hours of CS 599 thesis\nThe program is identical to the traditional M.S. program, with the \"Breadth Requirement\" satisfied while still classified as an undergraduate.\nStudents who take the \"Breadth Requirement\" courses for 3 credit hours instead of 4 credit hours will need to complete a minimum of 19 additional coursework hours.\nAdditional Coursework: Graduate (400- and 500-level) coursework from Computer Science, other Grainger College of Engineering Departments, MATH, STAT, or PHYS are pre-approved as Additional Coursework. All other courses must receive prior approval from the CS Graduate Advising Office in order to satisfy degree requirements.\nStudents must satisfy the university's graduate student minimum residence requirement.\nStudents must complete the remaining M.S. degree requirements in one academic year (fall-spring-summer or spring-summer-fall).\nStudents must maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 through the completion of the M.S. component of the program.\nUniversity Residency Requirements\nUndergraduate residency requirements include a student spending the first three years, earning not less than 90 semester hours, or the last year (two semesters or the equivalent), earning not fewer than 30 hours, in residence at the Urbana-Champaign campus, uninterrupted by any work in another institution. Graduate residency requirements include that half or more of the graduate hours applied toward the degree must be earned in courses counted for residence credit. Consult the University of Illinois Programs of Study book for additional details about university residency requirements.\nAdditional Information\nStudents may earn graduate hours for the M.S. component \"Breadth Requirement\" taken during the third and fourth year while a classified undergraduate. Students are required to perform and be graded at the (more advanced) graduate student level in those courses or must register in the graduate level section of a course when offered.\nStudents who do not complete all 5-Year B.S.- M.S. degree program requirements may request by petition to have graduate hours earned, including the Breadth Requirement coursework, converted to undergraduate hours and applied toward a traditional B.S. in Computer Science degree. Students who reverted to the B.S. degree program must earn the minimum number of hours and satisfy all degree requirements of whichever version of the B.S. curriculum is appropriate. Graduate credit not used to fulfill the B.S. degree requirements will remain on the transcript and may, at some point, be considered for transfer to another degree program.\nStudents are strongly advised to seek faculty counsel about the 5-year program to be sure they understand the pros and cons of pursuing a Masters's degree via the 5-year program. If they intend to ultimately pursue a Ph.D., then it may be preferable to avoid the rapid pace of the 5-year program and instead invest time in research as an undergraduate. For admission to competitive Ph.D. programs, the expectation of publications and extensive research experience is higher for M.S. graduates. Therefore, as an alternative to the 5-year program, many top students may prefer to conduct research, possibly leading to a B.S. thesis, to improve their admissions chances into top Ph.D. programs.\nDegree Conferral & Commencement\nSee: Fifth Year Master's Degree Conferral & Commencement Policies\nGraduate Academic Office Contact Information\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE\nGraduate Academic Office\nUniversity of Illinois\n201 North Goodwin, 1312 Siebel Center\nUrbana, IL 61801\n\nCampus Mail Code: MC-258\nPhone: (217) 333-4428\nFax: (217) 244-6073\nEmail: academic@cs.illinois.edu\nOFFICE HOURS\nMonday \u2013 Friday\nMorning: 8:00 AM to 11:45 AM\nAfternoon: 1:00 PM to 4:45 PM\nWalk-in advising hours start at 10:00 AM\nList of Graduate Advising Contacts and Virtual Advising Queue"}, {"url": "https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ican", "data": "HomeAcademicsGraduate AcademicsIllinois Computing Accelerator...\nIllinois Computing Accelerator for Non-Specialists (iCAN)\nAcademics Overview\nInstructional Area\nUndergraduate Academics\nGraduate Academics\nPhD Program\nMS Program\nMS in Bioinformatics Program\nProfessional Master of Computer Science\nFifth Year Master's Programs\nIllinois Computing Accelerator for Non-Specialists (iCAN)\nGraduate Forms & Advising Resources\nCourses\nHonor Code\nStudent Resources\nQUICK LINKS\n  Admissions Q&A Sessions\nIs iCAN Right for You?\nAdmissions Requirements\nApplication Process\niCAN Curriculum\nTuition and Fees\nFAQs\nContact iCAN\nNews\nMeet Our Students\nApplications for the next iCAN cohort will open in October 2023.\n    Is the iCAN Program Right For You?\niCAN is suitable for all non-specialists who want a deeper understanding of computers, algorithms, and programming in order to gain entry into a high-tech career or further their education in a graduate degree program. iCAN students come from all college backgrounds (English, business, marketing, political science, biology, civil engineering) and bring a unique perspective to computing.

The Professional MCS is a non-thesis (coursework-only) degree that requires 32 hours of graduate coursework to complete. At least four courses must be chosen from unique \u201ccore\u201d areas of computer science, and 12 hours must be at the advanced graduate level (500-level). \nSpace on campus is limited, but students have access to the greatest selection of courses to choose from in order to satisfy the MCS degree requirements. We also offer an Online MCS and Online MCS in Data Science, both through the Coursera platform, for busy professionals.\nApplication Information\nWho may apply? Applicants should hold a bachelor's degree in computer science, or if not, must have coursework (or commensurate experience) in object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, linear algebra and probability/statistics. The On-Campus MCS is designed to allow students to complete the degree in as little as one year with a maximum of three continuous semesters. (Full-time employees of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will be admitted only as on-campus students and may complete the program on a part-time basis.) The recommended undergraduate GPA for applicants applying to the Professional Master's program is a 3.2/4.0 or higher. The Department of Computer Science does not require GRE scores for any of its graduate programs. Applications for the MCS do not require letters of recommendation, but will be considered if included, especially if used to justify experience in lieu of required coursework, or other irregularities.\nApplication Deadlines\nApplication Process & Requirements\nCheck Status of Application Materials\nDEGREE REQUIREMENTS\nMaster of Computer Science (MCS) Requirements Table.\nDegree Planning Document [PDF].\nBreadth Requirement: 12-16 credit hours.\nMust complete four different courses, each from a different area, from the following ten core areas with a grade of B- or higher:\nArchitecture, Compilers, Parallel Computing: CS 426, 431, 433, 483, 484, 526, 533, 534, 536\nArtificial Intelligence: CS 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 540, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 588, 598 DL for Healthcare\nBioinformatics and Computational Biology: CS 466, 581, 582\nComputers and Education: CS 500\nDatabase and Information Systems: CS 410, 411, 412, 470, 510, 511, 512, 514\nInteractive Computing: CS 409, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 445, 465, 467, 469, 519, 565, 567, 568\nProgramming Languages, Formal Methods, Software Engineering: CS 421, 422, 427, 428, 474, 475, 476, 477, 521, 522, 524, 527, 576, 584\nScientific Computing: CS 450, 482, 554, 555, 556, 558\nSecurity and Privacy: CS 461, 463, 562, 563\nSystems and Networking (includes real-time systems and security): CS 414, 423, 424, 425, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 461, 463, 498 Cloud Computing Applications, 523, 525, 537, 538, 541, 563\nTheory and Algorithms: CS 473, 475, 507, 571, 573, 574, 579, 580, 583, 586\nAdvanced Coursework: 12 credit hours with a grade of C or higher.\nMust be computer science courses numbered CS 500-590 or 598.
